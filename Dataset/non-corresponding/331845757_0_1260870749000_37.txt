<edit_text>A computer, in the broadest sense, is a device for storing and processing information. In an ordinary digital computer, information is represented by electronic circuits that have two stable states, often denoted 0 and 1. In a brain, information is represented both dynamically, by trains of action potentials in neurons, and statically, by the strengths of synaptic connections between neurons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott&quot; /&gt; In a digital computer, information is processed by a small set of <strong><strike>&amp;quot;registers&amp;quot;</strike></strong><strong>[[Processor register|registers]]</strong> that operate at speeds of billions of cycles per second. In a brain, information is processed by billions of neurons all operating simultaneously, but only at speeds around 100 cycles per second. Thus, brains and digital computers are similar in that both are devices for processing information, but the ways that they do it are very different.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>The brain (or better encephalon) is the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate, and most invertebrate, animals....The most straightforward scientific evidence that there is a strong relationship between the physical brain matter and the mind is the impact physical alterations to the brain have on the mind, such as with traumatic brain injury and psychoactive drug use. Actually that appears non sure in many cases, where the mind's problems are not reducible to brain. I undid these. They may be valuable, but need explanation and citations. Anthony (talk) 10:52, 15 December 2009 (UTC) I agree that Anthony's edit was appropriate. --Tryptofish (talk) 19:04, 15 December 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
