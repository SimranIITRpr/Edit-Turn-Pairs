<turn_topictext>Brown has fathered five children with multiple women.[1] After reviewing the source, I don’t think this information is credible. It is diminishing to Brown’s career, and I don’t think we should include it unless it’s confirmed by Brown, or it is supported by something other than a rant on Instagram by some person. Let me know!

This information is credible. USA Today is not the only source available. Brown has confirmed that he has five children with three mothers. Please stop deleting relevant and accurate information. If you want to correct something, then please correct it and cite your sources. — Preceding unsigned comment added by WikiHogan654 (talk • contribs) 05:01, 21 November 2018 (UTC)
In the source provided, it blatantly based its claims off of the Instagram post I mentioned earlier, which is why I questioned the credibility of your source. Furthermore, it is your responsibility to find accurate sources about your edits. I still researched this, and I did find this[2] to be the most credible. I see this has already been cited by someone else in the article. Just make sure to provide accurate sources. Thanks! Apoorv Chauhan (talk) 21:33, 21 November 2018 (UTC)
