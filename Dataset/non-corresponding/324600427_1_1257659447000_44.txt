<edit_comment>/* Conferment */ I think we should leave out the US and British Unknowns and Awards until we actually see eye to eye</edit_comment>
<edit_text>To date, though, no Canadian Victoria Cross has been conferred; Smokey Smith, who died in 2005, was the last Canadian recipient of the British Victoria Cross, receiving it from King George VI in 1945. Prior to the ceremony, there was speculation that Queen Elizabeth II would, at the rededication of the Vimy Memorial at which she was to preside on 7 April 2007, present a Victoria Cross to her Canadian Prime Minister at the time, Stephen Harper, in recognition of the gallantry of the Unknown Soldier, as representative of all Canadian forces casualties of combat.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was met with a mixed response from members of the Royal Canadian Legion and Canadian Forces, detractors feeling that the Unknown Soldier should not be elevated above his other fallen comrades, and it had also been agreed at the time of the Unknown Soldier's repatriation that no award or decoration would be bestowed on the remains.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the plan was <strong><strike>quietly dropped, leaving</strike></strong><strong>taken about</strong> the Canadian Unknown Soldier distinct from both his American and British counterparts, the former having received the British Victoria Cross and the latter the American Medal of Honor.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>There seems to be some confusion about the awarding of medals to Unknown Soldiers: A couple of times now, editors have changed the text to: "The American Unknown Soldier is presented the Medal of Honor while the British Unknown Soldier is presented the British Victoria Cross." This is not the case, however; in fact, the opposite is true: The American Unknown Soldier was presented with the British Victoria Cross while the British Unknown Soldier was presented with the Medal of Honor. It was an exchange of medals between nations, not nations awarding themselves medals. The simple exchange of decorations does somehow appear more complex than it actually was; but, we must be careful not confound ourselves and, consequently, Wikipedia readers. --border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%background-color:black;color:whiteĦ color:blackMIESIANIACAL 05:59, 8 November 2009 (UTC) As I explained on your talk page, the last paragraph is explaining on should the Canadian VC be presented to the Canadian Unknown Soldier. I cannot attest to what the British do, but in the in the USA, we award the Medal of Honor to the Unknown Soldier of the USA (while do we give it also to the British Unknown, but that is not relevant for this specific article). User:Zscout370 (Return Fire) 06:13, 8 November 2009 (UTC)The sentence, it seemed to me, was intended to show how the Canadian unknown soldier differed from his British and American counterparts in that each of the latter had recieved from foreign nations their highest bravery decorations: The American Unknown Soldier received the British Victoria Cross on 11 November 1921,http://www.history.army.mil/books/Last_Salute/Ch1.htm, and the British Unknown Soldier received the American Medal of Honor on 4 March 1921.http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/asaoc.html I only just found out, and was about to add in the article, that the US Unknown Soldier also received the Medal of Honor on 11 November 1921;[first link] so, it seems we were both correct, at least in terms of the American Unknown Soldier. I can't find anywhere that the British Unknown Soldier was ever awarded the British Victoria Cross.Just for everyone's clarification, including my own: American Unknown Soldier:
Received: British Victoria Cross, US Medal of Honor
Date: 11 November 1921
British Unknown Soldier:
Received: US Medal of Honor
Date: 4 March 1921
Canadian Unknown Soldier:
Received: Zilch --border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%background-color:black;color:whiteĦ color:blackMIESIANIACAL 06:50, 8 November 2009 (UTC)
I just think it would be easier for the both of us to just not include the fact about the US and British Unknowns. User:Zscout370 (Return Fire) 07:49, 8 November 2009 (UTC)
Mmm.. Well, perhaps the information is somewhat trivial. I won't object if you feel it's better left out. --border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%background-color:black;color:whiteĦ color:blackMIESIANIACAL 17:17, 9 November 2009 (UTC)It was going to be a situation where we would have included all nations that award their Unknown Soldier with their top decoration or include none. I feel none is the better solution. User:Zscout370 (Return Fire) 21:38, 9 November 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
