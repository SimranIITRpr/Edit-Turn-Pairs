<edit_text>The Victoria Cross (Post-nominal letters &quot;VC&quot;) is the highest award for valour that can be awarded to members of the Canadian armed forces of any rank in any service, and allies serving under or with Canadian military command and is presented to the recipient by the Governor-General of Canada during an investiture. The Canadian version is based on the original Victoria Cross instituted in 1856 although the Canadian medal has several small changes in its appearance. It is awarded only for extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing a hostile force. Since its creation in 1993, no one has received this award.<strong> The Victoria Cross can be awarded multiple times.</strong></edit_text>
