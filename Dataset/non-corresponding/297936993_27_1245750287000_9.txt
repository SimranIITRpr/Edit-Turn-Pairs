<edit_comment>/* Worship and liturgy */</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Today, The United Methodist Church has official liturgies for services of Holy Communion, baptism, weddings, funerals, ordination, anointing of the sick, and daily office prayer services, as well as special services for holy days such as All Saints Day, Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Vigil. These services (traditionally called &quot;the ritual&quot;) are contained in The United Methodist Hymnal and The United Methodist Book of Worship.&lt;ref&gt;2008 Book of Discipline paragraph 1114.3&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, congregations also use other elements commonly associated with liturgical worship such as candles, a pulpit robe or other vestments on the minister, paraments on the altar-table, banners, liturgical art, the Apostles' Creed, and following the Christian Calendar. Like the Anglicans, the United Methodist Church also believes in rememebering the saints. In most cases these liturgies are derived from the [[<strong>Anglicanism|</strong>Anglican]] tradition's Book of Common Prayer. Many congregations are highly liturgical and follow these official services quite closely while others do not.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Should something be added about how the UMC allows votive candles and the performance of the sign of the cross? Tarheelz123 (talk) 22:59, 1 June 2009 (UTC) When and where? Neither of these practices is an official or unofficial practice in the United Methodist Church. While converts from other Anglo-Catholic traditions may continue these practices from their previous faith tradition, they simply are not part of the United Methodist practice of faith. Revmqo (talk) 11:44, 23 June 2009 (UTC) That is a really misleading title "semi-catholic traditions." There are many traditions (Anglicanism, Lutheranism, Orthodoxy) that follow those practices. I don't think those need to be mentioned in the article itself, however. KitHutch (talk) 17:42, 24 June 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
