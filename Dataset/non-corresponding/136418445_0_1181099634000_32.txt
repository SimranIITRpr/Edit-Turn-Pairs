<edit_text>Structure
<strong><em>[[Image:Mono-und-Polymere.svg|thumb|right|200px|Some antibodies form [[protein structure|complexes]] that bind to multiple antigen molecules.]]

Immunoglobulins are heavy plasma proteins, with sugar chains added to amino acid residues by N-linked glycosylation and occasionally by O-linked glycosylation, such as in IgA1 and IgD.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, antibodies are glycoproteins. The basic unit of each antibody is a monomer with one Ig unit but secreted antibody can also be dimeric with two Ig units as with IgA, tetrameric with four Ig units like teleost fish IgM, or pentameric with five Ig units, like mammalian IgM.&lt;ref name = roux&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>I've noticed that a lot of reviewers want to see history sections in articles when they are proposed for the higher levels (!) so I put together a little mish-mash of history that I could find out there. I can't seem to make it flow though...any good copy-editors want to have a go?? Ciar 05:13, 6 June 2007 (UTC) Ciar 21:27, 20 May 2007 (UTC) Done. TimVickers 15:57, 6 June 2007 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
