<edit_text>Three days before the 1995 Illinois state finals, Steinmetz High School was able to secure copies of the tests&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; from the DeVry Institute of Technology where the state finals were being held.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With the tests in hand, they were able to look up and memorize the answers<strong><strike> which they then memorized</strike></strong>. The first clue pointing towards foul play was that a mere 12 students in the nation had scored over 900 points on the Math test. Six of those scores came from Steinmetz High School.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The cheating resulted in Steinmetz beating perennial powerhouse Whitney Young Magnet High School who has won the Illinois state finals 22 out of the last 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was dramatized in the movie Cheaters. If cheating is suspected, USAD's official stance is that the team will have to take another set of tests of similar difficulty, or face disqualification.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Well, I know USAD no longer has anything about this at usad.org, but for the first two years that they offered Small-School E-Nationals, the guidelines were fewer than 950 students, not &lt; 650. I guess to allow for a broader net? It wasn't until they added the Medium School category that the current school size guidelines were established. I'll look into digging up a source on that one, but if I can't find one, shall I just add it anyway? TechVars (talk) 04:08, 11 April 2009 (UTC) I think it would be best if you found a source for it first. I'll take a look into some of the archives we have used (just take a look at the citations) and hope that some of them mention that. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 15:01, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
