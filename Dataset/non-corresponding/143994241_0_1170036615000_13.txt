<turn_topicname> Schitt’s Creek should be listed as a CBC production.</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Schitt’s creeks original network is CBC television and it should be recognized as such. Pop has nothing to do with the actual production of Schitt’s Creek it just televises it in the US. Reagansicard (talk) 20:12, 16 July 2019 (UTC)

I empathize but the networks are listed based on what’s in the nominations, and the TV Academy (understandably as an American organization) has decided to list the U.S. broadcaster regardless of which broadcaster commissioned them originally. Same issue for Bodyguard and Fleabag (both commissioned by the BBC).</turn_topictext>
