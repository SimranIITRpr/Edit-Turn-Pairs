<edit_comment>/* Plot */  Clarified the plot a little more/ improved wording a bit</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Meanwhile, Shreck discovers that his secretary, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), has discovered the true nature of the power plant: it will suck and store the power of Gotham City and make a huge profit for the Shreck family. Shreck attempts to kill Selina by pushing her out of the window of the office, but she survives the fall, mysteriously revived by alley cats who tried to eat her, and she takes up the mantle of Catwoman, dedicating her life to feminism in an exceedingly aggressive manner. A Red Triangle clown kidnaps the Mayor's infant son into the sewers, where the child is subsequently &quot;rescued&quot; by the Penguin. In return, he is allowed access into the Hall of Records to discover his parents' identity and therefore his real name: Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot. He publicly forgives his now-deceased parents for abandoning him, and wins the sympathy of the public, except for Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton), who is skeptical of Penguin's heroics and eventually links Cobblepot to several child disappearances over the past few years<strong><strike> and realis</strike></strong><strong>.  Wayne soon realiz</strong>es that Cobblepot is the leader of the Red Triangle gang. Wayne attempts to warn Shreck, but Shreck, who is in on Cobblepot's plans, refuses to listen, and instead uses the gang's past crimes to defame the Mayor and propose a recall election, making Cobblepot a possible candidate. During the next attack by the Red Triangle gang, Catwoman runs into Batman meets Catwoman, who destroys a part of Shreck's department store, and pushes her off a building; she lands safely in a sand-filled truck bed leaving the area.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Christmas film?</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Any idea why this is categorized as a Christmas film? I don't see any real reference to Christmas in the text. I'm currently tagging for the Christmas task force and, maybe, Christmas portal, and wouldn't mind having a GA to add to the portal rotation, but am not sure whether this article really relates to Christmas or not, or even why the category is there. John Carter (talk) 02:02, 5 December 2009 (UTC) Just the plot is happening around the time of christmas and you can see a christmas tree and some presents in it. Nonetheless, I would NOT categorize it as a "christmas movie". If we categorize every movie which shows christmas trees or some part of the plot take place by the time of christmas, we would have to categorize Die Hard as a christmas movie (which someone already did!!). ThatÂ´s quite strange and pointless and has of course nothing to do with christmas movies. Well, some people overdo things! --93.133.215.199 (talk) 11:28, 14 February 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
