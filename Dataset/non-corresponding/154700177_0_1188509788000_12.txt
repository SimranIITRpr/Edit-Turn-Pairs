<turn_topictext>Wow, look at those internet drama. First put on hold by Flubeca, then passed by Tarret after 43 mins, 9 mins later Giggy spotted FUR problem, couple of days later Tarret replied why he took over the review. Anyways, back to topic, Flubeca's points are valid, I am concerned about no reference on the lead section "receipent gets $3000 per year". Since nobody improved it drammatically for over a month, I'm going to delist it now. font-weight:bold#0000FFOhanaUnitedfont-weight:boldgreenTalk page 14:45, 21 August 2007 (UTC) The point about the "$3000 per year" is referenced later in the article. Gimmetrow 04:49, 22 August 2007 (UTC)Yes, i have notified User:OhanaUnited about it on User talk:OhanaUnited#Victoria Cross (Canada) her talk page. I have asked for clarification on the specific reasons why it was delisted.
