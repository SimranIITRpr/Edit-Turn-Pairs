<edit_text>1968–2000
The Academic Decathlon was formed in 1968 by Dr. Robert Peterson, who was the superintendent of schools in Orange County, California.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural competition was held in December 1968, and played host to 103 students.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, only regional contests were held, but as early as 1969 there was a push to make the competition state-wide.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 the competition was made to include the entire state of California.&lt;ref name=&quot;tad&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the nation-wide United States Academic Decathlon Association was formed. In April 1982, they held the first national competition at Loyola Marymount University in California; 16 states and the District of Columbia participated.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dr. Peterson's vision was bigger than just a national event. Inspired by the presence of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he sought to bring the competition to the international level.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This goal was realized at the 1984 Nationals which drew teams from 32 states, Canada, <strong><strike>[[Mexico]]</strike></strong><strong>Mexico</strong>, New Zealand and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of foreign countries is not a regular occurrence however. The next occurrence of international participation was at the 1989 national competition when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a school from British Columbia, Canada, is the only foreign competitor to have made a grab for the national title, having unsuccessfully done so in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear why international competition has been so minimal.</edit_text>

There is also concern that the competitions take up too much time. The National Association of Secondary School Principals, which publishes an annual list of contests and activities, does not endorse national contests that require team competition at a common site.'We do discourage national competitions of all kinds, said Scott D. Thomson, executive director of the association. They draw too much of the students' time and attention away from their regular schoolwork, But he added that the association did not object to the competitions themselves. We're opposed to the national dimension of it, Mr. Thomson said, not the academic competition dimension of it."

Anything else along these lines that people could think of? Criticisms of USAD is probably the only real thing missing from this article; a prose cleanup would be enough to get this article to FA. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 03:11, 4 April 2009 (UTC) About that LA Times article...I think that might be right here:http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/12/local/me-18619 I also found a few articles discussing that year's...issues. http://acadectalk.com/index.php?showtopic=3757 - Time, http://acadectalk.com/index.php?showtopic=3757 - Editorial by Larry Jones, posted on ADT by a decathlete from PA.
