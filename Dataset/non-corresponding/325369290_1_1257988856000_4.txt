<edit_text>Turing's mother, however, strenuously argued that the ingestion was accidental, due to his careless storage of laboratory chemicals. Biographer Andrew Hodges suggests that Turing may have killed himself in an ambiguous way quite deliberately, to give his mother some plausible deniability.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, 1983, pp. 488, 489&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the 1938 film Snow White, his favourite fairy tale<strong><strike>.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ferris, Timothy. ''Seeing</strike></strong><strong>, pointing out that he took &quot;an especially keen pleasure</strong> in the Dark (2002), p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Still others&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; speculate that he may have been murdered by the British Secret Service.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Timothy Ferris book quote</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Is there any stronger evidence for Snow White having been Turing's "favorite fairy tale"? Did the cited author -- Timothy Ferris -- know Turing or have a source who did? The language of his book's one Turing reference doesn't seem to imply as much. http://books.google.com/books?id=9gUjaCMlX5oC&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;ots=BLxO_vDEe6&amp;dq=timothy%20ferris%20alan%20turing%20apple%20favorite&amp;pg=PA250#v=onepage&amp;q=turing --Bcjordan (talk) 19:17, 11 November 2009 (UTC) David Leavitt's book also mentions it several times, describing the big impact the movie had on Turing. Diego (talk) 20:22, 11 November 2009 (UTC) Anyone have a copy of David Leavitt's book (I haven't been able to find a searchable preview) to pull a relevant passage or page number from so someone can attach a robust citation or qualify/remove this claim? Leavitt (born 1961) was not a contemporary of Turing's -- Leavitt's writing may explicate the claim's origins, I just can't find it elsewhere online (save for statements citing Wikipedia as source). --Bcjordan (talk) 02:12, 12 November 2009 (UTC) I have a copy of the book, and the claim appears to be perfectly true. I'll add a citation. --Malleus Fatuorum 02:20, 12 November 2009 (UTC) Thanks Malleus! *YOU* are why Wikipedia is academically compatible :) --Bcjordan (talk) 02:14, 13 November 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
