<edit_text>An antibody or immunoglobulin is a large Y-shaped glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. An antibody contains two sites called paratopes that recognize a target, known as an antigen.&lt;ref name=Janeway5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This huge diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide diversity of antigens. The unique part of the antigen recognized by an antibody is called an epitope<strong><strike> that</strike></strong><strong>, which</strong> fits precisely with a specific paratope in a manner similar to a key fitting into a lock. This highly specific lock and key interaction allows an antibody to distinguish foreign molecules from an organism's own molecules, and tag a pathogen or an infected cell for attack by cells and molecules of the immune system. The antibody can also neutralize its antigen target directly by, for example, binding to and blocking part of a pathogen essential for its survival and growth in the body.&lt;ref name=Rhoades&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Difficult to Understand</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Hello, as someone who has only an "average" understanding of chemistry and medicine, I found that this article was too technical. While I liked the indepth explanations, I simply could not understand the paragraphs included under "Definition", "Structure of the antibody" and "Isotypes". I hope I did not offend the author(s) of this article -- just keep it safe for the non Ph.D.s and MDs! :) Nobody said biology was simple. However, if something is not understandable, you can ask questions (be specific) and the authors or me at least will detail it further so the article will gradually become more readable. Anyway, if someone has a clear idea how to make this article more simple while at the same time keeping it accurate and all the facts included, just feel free to do it. --Eleassar777 23:52, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC) It is difficult to understand, more difficult than it needs to be. This is probably a function of cutting and pasting sentences from other resources like http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/encyclopedia/a/an/antibody.htm. There are also a few contradictions, for example "The monomer is composed of two heavy and two light chains" - an unusual use of the word monomer. When I have some time I'll clean this article up a bit. You are welcome to do so and thank you for having come here. Yes, perhaps this is an unusual use of the word monomer, however it is generally used in such a context. The other thing I wish to point out is that all the resources I used were offline resources, that are stated below, and some text (from the page you give) was written before I came here. Also, please use your signature. You create it with three tildes ). Four tildes gives also the time and date you came here. Thanks. --Eleassar777 09:08, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC) The immune system is a fascinating subject, but IMHO - this article is way too complicated for an encyclopedia. Also, it doesn't seem to link up with other parts of the immune system (unless it's buried and I missed it...) I remember understanding these processes backwards and forwards in college - but when I read this - I'm like, huh? Did something change in the last 3 years? I know there were some advances but this is really hard to absorb. I'd edit it myself but it's over my head at the moment. The immune system can be made much more easy to understand... like any subject. Even nuclear physics can be explained simply...and that involves math!</turn_topictext>
