<edit_text>File:Victoria Cross of Canada (Second award).jpg The design of the Canadian medal is derived from that of the British original, which was the creation of Albert, Prince Consort,&lt;ref name=DNDVC&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; royal consort to Queen Victoria. Canada's Victoria Cross is thus a cross patt√©e with straight arms, across in each direction, and made out of bronze coloured alloy, the obverse bearing a lion crowned and statant guardant, similar to that which forms the crest of the Royal Arms of Canada, standing upon a St. Edward's Crown, which itself rests above a semi-circular scroll. On the reverse is a raised circle for engraving the date of the act of gallantry along with the name, rank, and unit of the recipient.&lt;ref name=DNDVC /&gt; The medal is suspended from a link forming the letter V attached to a bar adorned on the front with laurel leaves, and on the reverse with the name, rank, and unit of the medal's recipient,&lt;ref name=Reynolds38 /&gt; all cast in the same metal as the medal, while the ribbon, also <strong><strike>38mm</strike></strong><strong>{{Nowrap|38 mm}}</strong> wide, is solid crimson in colour.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cathy Bursey-Sabourin, Fraser Herald of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, and Bruce W. Beatty, however, made certain modifications for the Canadian Victoria Cross, the most notable being the inclusion of Canadian flora as decoration and the alteration of the inscription on the scroll from FOR VALOUR to the Latin translation, PRO VALORE,&lt;ref name=DNDVC /&gt; so as to accommodate Canada's two official languages.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>criteria: detached body of individuals</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Canada doesn't have and never has had Marines. Admittedly, there is some confusion as the Navy is often referred to as "Marine" in French, but if one is speak of a detached body of sailors, in English, they are referred to as "sailors", and not "marines". I think the idea of the example is valid (ie. to explain a detached body), but the terminology would lead to confusion. Anyone have any better ways to phrase it?
