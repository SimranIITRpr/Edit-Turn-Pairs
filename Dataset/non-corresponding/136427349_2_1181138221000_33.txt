<edit_text>Image:Immunoglobulin basic unit.svg The variable region of the heavy chain is different for each individual B cell, but is the same for all <strong><strike>immunoglobulin</strike></strong><strong>antibodie</strong>s produced by the same B cell or B cell clone. The variable domain of any heavy chain is composed of a single immunoglobulin domain. These domains are each about 110 amino acids long.</edit_text>
