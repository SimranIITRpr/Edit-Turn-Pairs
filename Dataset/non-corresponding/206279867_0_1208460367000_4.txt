<edit_text>The next year, Bonds' offensive production reached even higher levels, breaking not only his own personal records but several major league records. In the Giants' first 50 games in 2001, Bonds hit 28 home runs, including 17 in May—a career high.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also hit 39 home runs by the All-star break (a major league record), drew a major league record 177 walks, and had a .515 on-base average, a feat not seen since Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams over forty years earlier. Bonds' slugging percentage was a major league record .863 (411 total bases in 476 at-bats), and, most impressively, he ended the season with a major league record 73 home runs.<strong>&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2001.shtml#NLmvp|title=2001 National League Most Valuable Player Award |accessdate=2008-04-17|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Baseball-Reference.com}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;</strong></edit_text>

The vast majority of the "San Francisco Giants (1993–2007)" section needs a lot more sources.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 18:10, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
"2005 season" part needs a lot more sources.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 20:37, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
The vast majority of the "2006 season" part needs more sourcing.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 21:26, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
"2007 season" part looks OK with sources, but this part needs source: "Bonds concluded the 2007 season with a .276 batting average, 28 home runs, and 66 RBIs in 126 games and 340 at bats. At the age of 43, he led both leagues in walks with 132."--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 12:13, 5 April 2008 (UTC)
Need source for the last part of the "Players' Union" section.Could not find source, but hid text in comments.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 21:42, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
"Bonds on Bonds" needs sourcing and a little expansion.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 22:05, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
"Personal life" needs expanding to at least a decent paragraph. --TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 23:32, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
Where do all the facts from the "Career Distinction" section come from? Needs sourcing.
We don't need that many links in the "See also" part IMO.I have removed the only two that don't have articles. I think everyone on any of the remaining lists should have it linked in their see also section.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 22:12, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
I'm failing the article, as finding sources for some of these may take quite a bit of time. Re-nominate at WP:GAN when the problems have been rectified. Regards, D.M.N. (talk) 14:34, 25 March 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
