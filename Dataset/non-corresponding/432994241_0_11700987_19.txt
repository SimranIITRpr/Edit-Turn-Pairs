<turn_topictext>Is this based on the Harrison short story of the same name?

I think it must be based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, perhaps by way of Coppola's Apocalypse Now? The Company (ivory traders, US Army, Spacecom) dispatches an expedition to the edge of the solar system (up the Congo, up the River) into the heart of darkness to find out what's become of their star employee (Kurtz, in both the Congo and Viet Nam, Clifford McBride here). Everyone speaks reverently of this hero, but it's clear he has gone off the rails and no one is willing to say how or why.... The purpose of the expedition is to recover or retrieve Kurtz and/or kill him. In the novel and in Apocalypse Now and in Ad Astra, it is never clear until the very end which option shall be taken. Ad Astra veers from this somewhat -- we never get the sense Roy might join his father; Roy does rescue his father (and the project's databanks) from the Lima vessel, but he dies anyway -- sort of like they writer wanted to have ALL possible endings rolled into one. So there you go</turn_topictext>
