<edit_comment>/* Gettysburg Address */ rephrase and add better cite</edit_comment>
<edit_text>The Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, Lincoln was <strong><strike>considered a Union victory, but the increased casualties dealt</strike></strong><strong>in</strong> a blow to Lincoln's war effort, and more troops were needed to refill the ranks. Lincoln's 1863 military drafts, which had been passed by Congress, were considered &quot;odious&quot; among many in the north, particularly immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p.449-452&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Draft Riots of July 1863 were the most notable manifestation of this discontent. The Governor of Pennsylvania, Andrew Gregg Curtin, reminded Lincoln that political sentiments were turning against him and the war effort. Therefore, in the fall of 1863, Lincoln was mindful of the need to increase public support for the war effort. This provided a major theme for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p.453-460&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Anyone know what page number it is? - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 04:06, 29 October 2010 (UTC) The sentence covers all of 1861-65 as does the book. see the TOC on amazon.com Rjensen (talk) 06:27, 29 October 2010 (UTC)Sounds good. - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 17:51, 29 October 2010 (UTC) Do you know about the Boritt, Gabor S. (1978). Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream. reference? Is it the whole book? - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 21:53, 29 October 2010 (UTC) I just looked at the Boritt book--the chapters are chronological and each one deals with the same themes (like banks and tariffs and RR) at different points in Lincoln's life, so the reference should be to the whole book, not to specific pages.Rjensen (talk) 00:37, 30 October 2010 (UTC) Thanks for the quick replies. Keep an eye out, because I may have another similar question. - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 00:45, 30 October 2010 (UTC) I think this is another one where the whole book is the cite. Not sure. I found pages for the specific dates, times, and number of words. See dif.http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abraham_Lincoln&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=394079692&amp;oldid=394078826 - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 00:52, 1 November 2010 (UTC) I've replaced the Tagg cite- it now references a magazine piece he did covering the point being made in the article and hopefully now we don't have a page problem (I didn't include an external link). I didn't know you were on this, since it wasn't on the GA page. Not too sure about how good a reference Tagg is, but that's another issue.Carmarg4 (talk) 14:17, 9 November 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
