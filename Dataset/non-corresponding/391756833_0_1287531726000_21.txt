<edit_text>Batman Returns would be the last film in the Batman film series that featured Tim Burton and Michael Keaton as director and leading actor, respectively. With Batman Forever, Warner Bros. decided to go in a &quot;lighter&quot; direction to be more mainstream in the process of a family film. Burton <strong><strike>was not interested</strike></strong><strong>had no interest</strong> in returning as director,&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt; but he did serve as a producer.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Burton, Michael Keaton, Joel Schumacher, Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—Reinventing a Hero, 2005, Warner Home Video&lt;/ref&gt; With Warner Bros. moving on development for Batman Forever in June 1993, a Catwoman spin-off was announced. Michelle Pfeiffer was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in Forever because of &quot;her own little movie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>If there are reliable, verifiable sources for both versions of wht Burton didn't direct the next film, both version should be in the article. Wikipedia doesn't get to push one version over the other. - J Greb (talk) 01:42, 20 October 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
