<turn_topicname>Aspirin the trademark</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>In the USA, Aspirin is a generic word so it can be identified in that country as "aspirin". alex is a pill popper. But in several countries, including Canada,http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/app/cipo/trademarks/search/viewTrademark.do;jsessionid=0000bhrjlQKm7ZH_n9KztQumGRa:1247nfca5?language=eng&amp;fileNumber=0990761&amp;extension=0&amp;startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1 Aspirin is still a registered trademark owned by Bayer. So should Aspirin be capitalised which trademarks usually are? Or should the article name be the scientific name "Acetylsalicylic acid" better known by the initials A.S.A.? Steelbeard1 (talk) 18:57, 29 August 2008 (UTC) I don't think WP need concern itself with trademark law in countries other than the US. ColinÂ°Talk 18:39, 7 September 2008 (UTC)I almost think that we should rename it "acetylsalicylic acid," just for conformity to international standards, although I think there is sometimes a bias toward the shorter name, all other things being equal. Is it pretty much around the English-speaking world that people call it "aspirin"? Simultaneous movement (talk) 15:25, 21 October 2008 (UTC)I think that would be a good idea -- of course "Aspirin" would redirect there and would be mentioned in the first sentence. Facts707 (talk) 10:39, 25 October 2008 (UTC)It is arrogant to suggest that WP should only be concerned with US trademarks. In many parts of the world "Aspirin" remains, as it originally was in the USA, a trademark of Bayer (in over 80 coutries). If WP is genuinely a global resource, it should put the primary article under the heading "acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)" with notation at the start to indicate that it is ALSO known generically as "aspirin" in France, Russia, the UK, and the USA. Enquire (talk) 08:59, 5 November 2008 (UTC)I created a subsection of History called "Trademark in some countries" that addresses the trademark and name capitalization issue with a couple of references. Facts707 (talk) 10:39, 25 October 2008 (UTC)Added ref to relevant portion of Treaty of Versailles. Facts707 (talk) 12:16, 25 October 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
