<edit_text>Beer is the world's most widely consumed&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and oldest&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;<strong>&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ji0tFmBd4d0C&amp;amp;pg=PA38&amp;amp;dq=oldest+beverage&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=d5ZdTIuZEuiX4gaht-H1Bw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=8&amp;amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=oldest%20beverage&amp;amp;f=false |title=Garlic, wine, and olive oil ... - Google Books |publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2010-08-07 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;</strong> alcoholic beverage; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Brewdog has just released a 55% alcohol beer.</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Also, some discussion should be devoted to the difference between percentage by volume and by weight, and the conversion of these two numbers. In several states, including Oklahoma and Utah, it's illegal to sell chilled beer that is over 3.2% ABV. To get beer of higher alcohol content, one must go to a "liquor store" or "package store", which, in the case of Utah, are all owned by the state. At these establishments, the beer, wine, and spirits are sold at room temperature. Also, federal law states that no alcoholic beverage over 4% ABW (alcohol by weight) may be labeled as Beer, thus the rise of the term "Malt Liquor" to denote high alcohol American-style beers. This is also why many microbrewed beers sold by the bottle are labeled with their style, such as Pale Ale, Stout, Porter, etc., rather than with the word "beer". font-size: smaller;autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.185.216.18 (talk) 16:34, 23 July 2010 (UTC) That is an interesting point about the selling of beer in the USA. Should we have a section about beer in different parts of the world, so we can cover location-specifics such as this? Similar to how beers above 10% are usually marketed as barley wines over here. font-size: smaller;autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by 80.6.35.235 (talk) 22:18, 5 August 2010 (UTC) holds articles that talk about alcohol measurement. There's an article about Alcohol by volume, though not one about ABW. I think there is a need for an overall article about alcohol measurement. This article wouldn't really be the appropriate place to start that, as this is about beer, rather than alcohol measurement. And articles about alcohol laws America are here: - with the main one - Alcohol law in the United States. border: 1px #F10; background-color:cream;Script MT#1111AA2SilkTork *YES! 17:44, 7 August 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
<turn_text>I just noticed the change in the opening. I've put it back to oldest, as that is what the source said. I just quickly added two more. I'll find an accessible scholarly source later, and replace all three with that. I have a vague memory of once before having several cites for that statement - though it may have been for something else. border: 1px #F10; background-color:cream;</turn_text>
