<edit_text>With Burton's hiring as director, Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay. Batman was not greenlighted until <strong>after </strong>the success of Burton's Beetlejuice (1988). The role of Batman was considered for numerous A-list actors, while Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated a high salary, a portion of the box office profits and his shooting schedule.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Sentence about awards was re-written for clarity. Original sentence made it look like there were many Academy Award nominations when there was only one. --Davmpls 01:54, 3 November 2009 (UTC) Movie not shown to have "inspired" animated series, but did "succeed" it. POV edit. --Davmpls 01:54, 3 November 2009 (UTC) autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by Davmpls (talk • contribs) Um...thanks. You didn't need to bring this to the talk page though. Simply putting it in your edit summary, which you did, is fine. Just so you know. Anakinjmt (talk) 04:04, 3 November 2009 (UTC)Well, you never know. Some people get very agitated if you edit anything. Better to say it and explain it.Davmpls 14:49, 3 November 2009 (UTC) autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by Davmpls (talk • contribs)</turn_topictext>
