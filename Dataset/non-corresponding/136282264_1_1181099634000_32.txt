<edit_text>Further protein and gene characteristics were discovered in the years that followed. Gerald Edelman and Joseph Gally discovered the antibody light chain in the early 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and realized it was same as the Bence-Jones protein described in 1845 by Henry Bence Jones.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edelman went on to discover that antibodies are composed of disulphide bond-linked heavy and light chains. Around the same time, antibody-binding (Fab) and antibody tail (Fc) regions of IgG were characterized by Rodney Porter.&lt;ref name=edel&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By working together, these <strong><strike>two </strike></strong>scientists went on to discover the structure and complete amino acid sequence of IgG, a feat for which they were jointly awarded the 1972 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine.&lt;ref name=edel/&gt; While most early antibody studies focused on IgM and IgG, other immunoglobulin isotypes were identified in the 1960s; Thomas Tomasi identified secretory antibody (IgA) in 1965,</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>I've noticed that a lot of reviewers want to see history sections in articles when they are proposed for the higher levels (!) so I put together a little mish-mash of history that I could find out there. I can't seem to make it flow though...any good copy-editors want to have a go?? Ciar 05:13, 6 June 2007 (UTC) Ciar 21:27, 20 May 2007 (UTC) Done. TimVickers 15:57, 6 June 2007 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
