<edit_text>Hamm's draft was considered dis<strong><strike>sa</strike></strong><strong>ap</strong>pointing, so Burton brought in Daniel Waters.&lt;ref name=Ressner/&gt; Burton was impressed with his work on Heathers, and originally brought him in for writing a sequel to Beetlejuice. A year later, however, Burton felt him to be perfect as Hamm's replacement.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; It was at this time that Warner Brothers decided to give Burton full creative control.&lt;ref name=Ressner/&gt; Burton was excited with Waters' new pitch that had an evil mogul (Max Shreck, whose name is a reference to the actor of the same name, who portrayed Count Orlok in Nosferatu)&lt;ref name=Walken/&gt; backing a bid for the Mayor's office by The Penguin.&lt;ref name=Ressner/&gt; Waters claimed that Hamm wrote a &quot;old-fashioned, almost like a Hardy Boys action adventure&quot;. On Hamm's original characterization of Catwoman, Waters stated that he &quot;went back to the comic book and the way comic books in general treat women, like a fetishy sexual fantasy&quot;. Waters felt that he needed to see the film through her point of view. He reinvented her as a secretary, feeling that she should &quot;start off just at the lowest point in society&quot;.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>GA Review</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>GA review (see here for criteria) It is reasonably well written.a (prose): b (MoS): It is factually accurate and verifiable.a (references): b (citations to reliable sources): c (OR): It is broad in its coverage.a (major aspects): b (focused): It follows the neutral point of view policy.Fair representation without bias: It is stable.No edit wars etc.: It is illustrated by images, where possible and appropriate.a (images are tagged and non-free images have fair use rationales): b (appropriate use with suitable captions): Overall: Pass/Fail: Comments: "DeVito was the first and only choice for the Penguin, and writer Daniel Waters wrote the character with him in mind; and in turn, DeVito spent two hours a day in make-up." (Cast) This sentence is very awkward; it is connected with a semi-colon, but I see no relation between what comes before the semi-colon and what comes after it. This would only make sense if you were trying to remark that on account of the fact Daniel Waters wrote the Penguin with DeVito in mind, DeVito spent (or was willing to spend) two hours a day in make-up. If so, there's better ways to phrase it. If not, then the sentence really needs some work. In either case, very confusing. Image:Yes check.svg I took out the make-up part as I don't really feel it's relevant that he spent two hours a day in prosthetics anymore. Wildroot 11:16, 08 January 2008 (UTC) "Burton felt that Pfeiffer "was the one and only other obvious choice for the role."" (Cast) A direct quote requires a direct cite, even if it's the same one used later in the paragraph. The same goes for "a most dumbfounded idea" under "Production", four more under "Writing", four more under "Music" and Waters' reference to Spiderman in "Reaction""Sean Young, who was originally cast in Kim Basinger's role as Vicki Vale in the first film before she became injured (in a horse riding accident), believed the role should have gone to her." (Cast) This sentence runs like it was in the New York Marathon. It should be split into two."Even though the film was considered by many to be "too dark,"" (Reaction) Is this presumption covered by the cite at the end of the paragraph. If so, it needs to be directly cited (see #2) or if not, it just needs to be cited period."Batman Returns is currently the fourth highest grossing Batman film to date," (Reaction) Encyclopedic articles, especially Good ones, should not be temporally dynamic; therefore "currently" should be replaced with something like "As of 2008". Same with "Currently it is the second highest ranked Batman film listed on Rotten Tomatoes, only below Batman Begins", which also requires a citation Image:Yes check.svg I took out that part as I don't really feel it's relevant or important anymore. Wildroot 11:22, 08 January 2008 (UTC) "This style of film making is what many consider "style-over-substance."" (Reaction) requires a citationSorry, I forgot one more thing, since I've changed my review style to review the lead last. The lead needs to conform to WP:LEAD. Specifically, it must cover all the major points/headings made in the body of the article. There is nothing on plot and not enough on production, at the very least. Also, it must not introduce any facts that are not present in the body of the article. The last sentence, about the third movie, doesn't seem to be in the body of the article, aside from the fact that Schumacher directed it. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Canadian Paul (talk • contribs) 19:07, 8 January 2008 (UTC) To allow for these changes to be made, I am placing the article on hold for a period of up to seven days, after which it may be failed without further notice. Thank you for your work thus far. Cheers, CP 08:15, 8 January 2008 (UTC) Image:Yes check.svg Well, everything is done. Cheers. Wildroot 15:57, 11 January 2008 (UTC) The lead still doesn't make reference to the "Music" section, or the awards that it was nominated for. Once it does, however, it should be ready for GA status. Cheers, CP 00:12, 12 January 2008 (UTC) Well, everything looks good now, so I'll be passing this as a Good Article. Congratulations, and thank you for your hard work!
