<edit_comment>/* Worship and liturgy */</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Today, The United Methodist Church has official liturgies for services of Holy Communion, baptism, weddings, funerals, ordination, anointing of the sick, and daily office prayer services, as well as special services for holy days such as All Saints Day, Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Vigil. These services (traditionally called &quot;the ritual&quot;) are contained in The United Methodist Hymnal and The United Methodist Book of Worship.&lt;ref&gt;2008 Book of Discipline paragraph 1114.3&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, congregations also use other elements commonly associated with liturgical worship such as candles, a [[<strong>geneva gown|</strong>pulpit robe]] or other vestments on the minister, paraments on the altar-table, banners, liturgical art, the Apostles' Creed, and following the Christian Calendar. Like the Anglicans, the United Methodist Church also believes in rememebering the saints. In most cases these liturgies are derived from the Anglican tradition's Book of Common Prayer. Many congregations are highly liturgical and follow these official services quite closely while others do not.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Evangelical</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>I saw that Kit Hutch removed "evangelical" from classification. What's the basis for this removal? At least historical, I believe the UMC is evangelical. I can see your point that it wouldn't fall in the same category as the pentecostal type of evangelicalism that's prevalent today, but the UMC seems very much an evangelical church in its history. Wsanders (talk) 17:48, 25 March 2008 (UTC) If we are defining "Evangelical" as an attempt to create converts, this article needs a section on its evangelical efforts notably missionary work. The Methodist Church has a colorful missionary history. I have a section on the capital of Kansas being originally in a Methodist Mission but I don't see where to flop it down. Americasroof (talk) 20:32, 25 March 2008 (UTC) In the sense of denominational orientation, "Evangelical" refers to a conservative movement emphasizing a personal relationship with Jesus. All mainline denominations have an evangelical wing. Therefore, it does not make sense to say that the UMC is both mainline and evangrlical because by saying "mainline," one is already implying an evangelical element. It is, however, possible to be evangelical without being mainline. This is different than evangelism, which is the spread of the faith to new followers. KitHutch (talk) 17:28, 26 March 2008 (UTC) No, the Church's official position is that it is an Evangelical Church; it does not imply conservatism. I have provided several official sources that buttress the Church's evangelical position at the top of this discussion page. On Maundy Thursday, I picked up an http://secure.umcom.org/store/product/The-people-of-The-United-Methodist-Church-Who-We-Are-Brochure,299,1.aspx published by United Methodist Communications. Within the brochure was eight categories that described the United Methodist Church. Two of these categories included Mission-oriented and Evangelical. Underneath the Evangelical category, the following words were written: Quae cum ita sint, I am adding this as another source in the information box and restoring the previous lead sentence. Americasroof, thanks for your information. I personally would suggest adding your information on missions in the Distinctive Wesleyan emphases section of the article, possibly with additional background information of the Church's history/commitment to missions and evangelism. With regards, AnupamTalk 05:33, 20 April 2008 (UTC) The church is definitely evangelical historically and presently. After all, not very many churches advertise that their doors are open to anyone (commercials and otherwise). Xe7al (talk) 06:46, 8 June 2008 (UTC) Yes, I agree. I have once again reverted the removal of this sourced information. Thanks for your input on the discussion. With regards, AnupamTalk 06:47, 8 June 2008 (UTC) The UMC is a mainline denomination. All mainline denominations have evangelical elements. It is redundant to say that the UMC is both mainline and evangelical!KitHutch (talk) 15:52, 27 May 2009 (UTC) I, along with other editors, have provided reasons given above as to why to keep the term evangelical in the infobox. Before taking the unilateral action of removing the term, I think it would be best to let other editors share their views, since you have decided to rehash this issue. I hope this helps. With regards, AnupamTalk 19:41, 27 May 2009 (UTC) I support KEEP. The official Web site of the UMC states: "Over the next quadrennium, the church will seek to focus the work of making disciples for Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world around these areas of ministry: -Combating the diseases of poverty by improving health globally.-Creating new places for new people and revitalizing existing congregations.-Developing principled Christian leaders for the church and the world.-Engaging in ministry with the poor." (http://www.umc.org/site/c.lwL4KnN1LtH/b.4443111/k.D720/Four_Areas_of_Ministry_Focus.htm) It further states: "The mission of the Church is to make disciples of Jesus Christ." (http://www.umc.org/site/c.lwL4KnN1LtH/b.1355349/k.FC63/Our_Faith.htm) Yes, it has taken a stand that it is evangelical when it says it's 'THE Mission.' Afaprof01 (talk) 21:02, 27 May 2009 (UTC) Using your definition, all Christian churches try to win converts. Therefore, all Christian churches are evangelical. Again, it is redundant to call the UMC both mainline and evangelical. KitHutch (talk) 12:56, 28 May 2009 (UTC) An interesting survey result about this may be seen at &lt;http://www.ellisonresearch.com/releases/20080903.htm&gt;. 36% of all Americans say they have no idea at all what an evangelical Christian is. The most common perception is that evangelicals are Christians who place a special emphasis on spreading their faith to other people. I believe today's UMC is making a concerted effort to go back to this part of their roots. I do not believe that definition applies to nearly all Christian churches. Afaprof01 (talk) 15:56, 28 May 2009 (UTC)Which Christian denomination doesn't want to win converts? KitHutch (talk) 18:20, 28 May 2009 (UTC) While it is true that all Christian denominations should be evangelical in focus, KitHutch misses the point that the word "Evangelical" can have more than one meaning/connotation... In the United Methodist context we not only seek to be evangelical, but we are out of a larger movement within Christianity that is in fact Evangelical! While Orthodoxy arises from orthodox(patristics) tradition and Anglicans from Catholicism, United Methodist derive their practice of faith from Evangelicalism. This is not a liberal vs conservative discussion but rather a question of origin. It may be true that elements within the denomination skew the term and philosophy that it represents in their favor, it does not however dismiss the fact that Methodism is at its heart "Evangelical." The Methodist's of old, and certainly the Evangelical United Brethren that joined to form the denomination would have serious issues with your argument. The word "Evangelical" absolutely does belong in any definition of the denomination. It is not a matter of redundancy, but rather one of accurately portraying ones past and prayerfully our Methodist future! Revmqo (talk) 12:06, 23 June 2009 (UTC) That's funny. I seem to remember from my Methodist confirmation classes that Methodist evolved out of Anglicanism in the 1700s. In fact, some "mainline non-evangelical" churches like the Episcopal Church and the Lutheran Church honor John and Charles Wesley as "renewers of the church." Yes, "evangelical" can have different meanings/connotations in different contexts. Lutherans originally called themselves "Evangelicals" after all. But all Christians are evangelical and seek to gain more coverts so calling the UMC "mainline" and "evangelical" is redundant. KitHutch (talk) 17:38, 24 June 2009 (UTC)Exactly. Evangelical is a word that was stolen from Mainline denominations by the Fundamentalist movement after the word Fundamentalist gained negative connotations. The UMC is only Evangelical in that it believes in Evangelism. There's no other way to word it. It is not the same thing.
