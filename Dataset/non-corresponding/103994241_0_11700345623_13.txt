<edit_text>==Smear campaign==
On July 23, 2018, an article in [[Dainik Jagran]] cited former Super 30 students who said that only three students from the program had passed the IIT JEE exam that year, contrary to Kumar's claim that 26 had passed.&lt;ref name="India Today"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/patna-super-30-anand-kumar-1293475-2018-07-23|title=Patna's Super 30 mentor Anand Kumar accused of deceit to gain popularity|date=2018-07-23|work=[[India Today]]|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also claimed that students who sought to enroll in Super 30 were pushed to enroll in another coaching center called Ramanuj Institute, a for-profit institution, on the pretext that Kumar would coach them if they performed well. Furthermore, the article alleged that by asking IIT aspirants to enroll in Ramanuj Institute, Kumar made over Rs 1 crore annually.&lt;ref name="India Today" /&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname> Why is he a mathematician?]</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Why is Anand Kumar called a mathematician? He is a mathematics teacher, a good one maybe, but what is the official wikipedia policy to designate someone as a mathematician?

2) His papers cannot be found in journals. There is a letter to the editor in "the mathematical gazette" which is by one Anand Kumar, but it is hardly and serious mathematics. I am removing the mentions that he has papers published in journal until someone finds these references.Breakfastisready (talk) 17:41, 7 June 2019 (UTC)

Because lots of reliable independent sources say that he is a mathematician (I am not going to list them all here, and I presume you can read). In WP, we don't get into trying to "prove" that someone is a mathematician (that would be WP:OR), we record what reliable independent sources say. The RS you deleted says During graduation, he submitted papers on Numbers Theory that were published in UK's Mathematical Spectrum and The Mathematical Gazette.. You are deleting the RS that supports the statement, nothing else is needed. If someone produced links to journals, they would have to be deleted as OR or PRIMARY.</turn_topictext>
