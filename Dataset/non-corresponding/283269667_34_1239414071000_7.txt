<edit_text>File:USAD medals.JPG All ten events are evenly weighted at 1,000 points for a possible 10,000 point individual total. Only the top two scores from Honors, Scholastic and Varsity are counted for the team score, making 60,000 the maximum overall. With the exception of Math and Super Quiz, the objective tests each have 50 questions each; each one is worth 20 points. The Math event has only 35 questions, weighted more heavily at approximately 28.6 points per question, with only 35 questions. The Super Quiz written test contains 40 questions, each worth 15 points. Depending on the state director, the oral component of Super Quiz contains either 5 or 10 questions, each worth 80 or 40 points respectively.&lt;ref name=essential_info /&gt; The written test may even be excluded entirely at the state level if a state director wishes to weigh<strong><strike>t</strike></strong> more heavily the oral component of the Super Quiz.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect scores of 1,000 in events are recorded regularly, and there have been cases of dozens of medal winners for a single event because of perfect and near–perfect scores.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded in each event and for each category (Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity). All ties are awarded medals.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Well, it's pretty well-known that all states use different medals. However, since this is the United States Academic Decathlon article, would it be better to instead use a picture of say, a bronze, silver &amp; gold medal from USAD itself? I know that the E-Nationals medals are the same as the Nationals medals, and I've taken at least one in every category. I could take a picture of them, and upload them to Wikimedia, if that would be helpful.autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by TechVars (talk • contribs) You know, that would be great. Do you think you could add the images? And if you have access to the medals with you, do you think you could get gold, silver, and bronze all in one shot? That would be greatly appreciated. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 03:39, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
