<edit_text>1968–2000
The Academic Decathlon was formed in 1968 by Dr. Robert Peterson, the superintendent of schools in [[Orange County,<strong><strike> California|Orange County,</strike></strong> California]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural competition was held in December 1968, and played host to 103 students.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Though at first only regional contests were held,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in 1979, the first state-wide competition was held.&lt;ref name=&quot;tad&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the nationwide United States Academic Decathlon Association was formed, which held its first national competition in April 1982 at Loyola Marymount University in California—16 states and the District of Columbia participated.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, Peterson, inspired by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1984 Nationals, 32 states as well as Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea fielded teams.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of foreign countries did not become not a regular occurrence, however. There was no more international participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a school from British Columbia, Canada, is the only foreign competitor to have competed at Nationals, having unsuccessfully done so in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear why international competition has been so minimal.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Medals Image</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Well, it's pretty well-known that all states use different medals. However, since this is the United States Academic Decathlon article, would it be better to instead use a picture of say, a bronze, silver &amp; gold medal from USAD itself? I know that the E-Nationals medals are the same as the Nationals medals, and I've taken at least one in every category. I could take a picture of them, and upload them to Wikimedia, if that would be helpful.autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by TechVars (talk • contribs) You know, that would be great. Do you think you could add the images? And if you have access to the medals with you, do you think you could get gold, silver, and bronze all in one shot? That would be greatly appreciated. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 03:39, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
