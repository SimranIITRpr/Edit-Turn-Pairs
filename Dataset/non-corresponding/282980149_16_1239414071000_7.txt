<edit_text>The events are split up into two groups: the seven objective tests (Art, Economics, Language and Literature, Math, Music, Science and Social Science) and the three subjective events (Essay, Interview and Speech). They are designated as such because the former seven are given as half-hour multiple choice tests, whereas the latter three are graded by judges. Students are given half an hour to answer each multiple choice exam. These exams consist of 50 questions<strong> each</strong>, with the exception of Math and Super Quiz, which have 35 and 40 questions respectively.&lt;ref name=essential_info&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Medals Image</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Well, it's pretty well-known that all states use different medals. However, since this is the United States Academic Decathlon article, would it be better to instead use a picture of say, a bronze, silver &amp; gold medal from USAD itself? I know that the E-Nationals medals are the same as the Nationals medals, and I've taken at least one in every category. I could take a picture of them, and upload them to Wikimedia, if that would be helpful.autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by TechVars (talk • contribs) You know, that would be great. Do you think you could add the images? And if you have access to the medals with you, do you think you could get gold, silver, and bronze all in one shot? That would be greatly appreciated. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 03:39, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
