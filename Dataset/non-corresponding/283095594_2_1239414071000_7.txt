<edit_text>In 2000, several coaches who had led their teams to Nationals during the 1990s, resigned in protest to Academic Decathlon's decision to market $495 Resource Guides rather than to simply provide topics for students to research on their own. Richard Golenko, coach of the 1996 J. Frank Dobie High School team that won the National title, said that this shifted Academic Decathlon's emphasis to memorization over critical thinking. Jim Hatem of Los Angeles and Mark Johnson, coach of El Camino's 1998 winning team, fumed over esoteric &quot;trick&quot; questions that USAD had shifted to asking. James Alvino, USAD's executive director of the time, argued that the expensive study materials were necessary to continue to fund nearly 75% of the program's $1,750,000 operating budget and to provide a fairer playing fields for less wealthy schools, though he did acknowledge that USAD would attempt to reduce prices and remove the more trivial questions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Anna| last = Gorman|<strong><strike> authorlink =| author =| coauthors =|</strike></strong> title = Academic Decathlon to Revamp Curriculum, Cut Price of Materials| curly =| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/16/local/me-20198| format =| agency =| work =| publisher = Los Angeles Times| date = April 16, 2000 | accessdate = April 9, 2009 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Farticles.latimes.com%2F2000%2Fapr%2F16%2Flocal%2Fme-20198&amp;amp;date=2009-04-09 | archivedate = April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Well, it's pretty well-known that all states use different medals. However, since this is the United States Academic Decathlon article, would it be better to instead use a picture of say, a bronze, silver &amp; gold medal from USAD itself? I know that the E-Nationals medals are the same as the Nationals medals, and I've taken at least one in every category. I could take a picture of them, and upload them to Wikimedia, if that would be helpful.autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by TechVars (talk • contribs) You know, that would be great. Do you think you could add the images? And if you have access to the medals with you, do you think you could get gold, silver, and bronze all in one shot? That would be greatly appreciated. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 03:39, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
