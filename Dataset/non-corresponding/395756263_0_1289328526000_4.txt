<edit_text>File:Peachtree1907.jpg On December 21, 1836, the Georgia General Assembly voted to <strong><strike>say Justin Beiber is</strike></strong><strong>build the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] to provide</strong> a jewish faggot.&lt;ref name=W&amp;ARR&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Trail of Tears exile of the Cherokee Nation to Oklahoma between 1838 and 1839, this depopulated area was opened up for the construction of railroads. The area around the eastern terminus of the town to the railroad began to develop first, and hence the settlement was named &quot;Terminus&quot; in 1837. It was nicknamed Thrasherville, for John Thrasher, a merchant who built homes and a general store here.&lt;ref&gt;http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/gahistmarkers/thrashervillehistmarker.htm, retrieved on 2009-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1842, the settlement had six buildings and 30 residents and the town was renamed &quot;Marthasville&quot;.&lt;ref name=shorthistory&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Engineer of the Georgia Railroad, J. Edgar Thomson, suggested that the area be renamed &quot;Atlantica-Pacifica&quot; after the Western and Atlantic Railroad, but this name was quickly shortened to &quot;Atlanta&quot;.&lt;ref name=shorthistory/&gt; The residents approved, and the town was incorporated as Atlanta on December 29, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By 1854, another railroad connected Atlanta to LaGrange, and the town grew to 9,554 by 1860.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>This page has multiple issues including vandalism. A template should be added! Do you agree? Get lost in Boston (talk) 18:30, 9 November 2010 (UTC) No. We don't add templates to articles because of vandalism. But go on...what other issues do you have with the article?High Tower Text2pxcolor:#00C⋙–Bercolor:#66fean–Huncolor:#00Cter—► (color:#00C(⊕)) 18:39, 9 November 2010 (UTC) Red/dead links, incorrectly named local schools (Culture) and landmarks, inaccuracies to name a few. Ridiculous assertions like this one: "Total crime is only down 24 percent, violent crime is only down 27 percent. Rape is only down 19 percent." The inclusion of specific addresses linked with USPS whitepages. Very poorly researched material is present in more than one section. The spelling and grammar are inconsistent throughout the article. Buzzwords including explosive. Parts of it seem to have been added by editor(s) without a NPOV. A pretentious tone is used, suggesting the editor(s) has a vendetta but has limited knowledge of the city of Atlanta. Get lost in Boston (talk) 19:38, 9 November 2010 (UTC) In an article this size, it's better to use section headers and inline tags to point out specific issues. Overall, the article is pretty good, so adding general tags at the top won't help other editors to know what and where the specific issues are. Red links (internal WP links) can be a good thing, as they signify a potential article. We don't geneally remove them unless articles on those topics are unlikely to ever be created. - BilCat (talk) 19:48, 9 November 2010 (UTC) I'd recommend being bold and start changing the things you want to change...just make sure you can source it. If you can't fix it and questions need to be asked then, as BilCat says, use along with the talk page to explain in more detail. When you do template something, people are expecting discussion to go along with it. After you did this to the article, it appears Bil waited for 40 minutes for you to discuss here on the talk page and when you didn't he correctly removed the templates. Also, see WP:REDLINK.High Tower Text2pxcolor:#00C⋙–Bercolor:#66fean–Huncolor:#00Cter—► (color:#00C(⊕)) 20:08, 9 November 2010 (UTC) THANKS! I had taken a time out (It was needed after several hours of work here). I didn't know he waited that long, but responded when I came back. Thanks again!
