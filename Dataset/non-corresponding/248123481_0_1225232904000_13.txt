<edit_text>The songs written by Prince were criticized for being &quot;too out of place&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; While Burton has stated he had no problem with the Prince songs, he was less enthusiastic with their use in the film.&lt;ref name=forever/&gt; On the film, Burton remarked &quot;I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It's OK, but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Nonetheless, the film received generally favorable reviews from critics. Based on 49 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 69% of reviewers have enjoyed Batman.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, Metacritic has collected an average score of 66, based on 17 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =

Burton biographer Alison McMahan wrote, &quot;fans of the ''Batman'' franchise complained when they heard of Michael Keaton's casting. However, no one complained when they saw his performance.&quot;&lt;ref name=cartoon/&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] called the film entertaining, with the highlight being the production design. However, he concluded, &quot;the best thing that can be said about ''Batman'' is that it led to ''[[Batman Returns]]'', which was a far superior effort.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[James Berardinelli]] | url = http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman.html | title = Batman (1989) | work = [http://www.reelviews.net/ ReelViews] | date = 2001-06-05 | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt &quot;Jack Nicholson stole every scene&quot; but still greeted ''Batman'' with positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788899.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | title = Batman | date = [[1989-01-01]] | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed &quot;''Batman'' is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19890623/REVIEWS/906230301/1023 | title = Batman | publisher = [[Roger Ebert]] | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' called the film &quot;watchable enough&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] | url = http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/769_BATMAN_AAA_burton | title = Batman | work =  [[Chicago Reader]] |date = [[1989-06-23]] | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

<turn_topicname>Reliable Sources</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Before I take this article to Featured Article Candidacy, I have to prove that the following websites are reliable sources: http://www.superherohype.com
http://www.snarkygossip.com
http://www.dailyscript.com
http://www.batmanytb.com
http://www.batman-on-film.com
http://www.scifiscripts.com
Since I have no way of explaining this, other than Being Bold, it's probably best to collect other opinions from editors. http://www.superherohype.com because it has its own page at Superhero Hype!, it that makes any sense. Batman-on-Film might pass since "Batman-related" filmmakers such as David Goyer, Michael Uslan and Chris Corbould call call it reliable. And nice. However, the other websites might be a little tricky. Alientraveller said it's good to only use sites like those for interviews and set visits, when information comes directly from the source. Then again, the doesn't explain http://www.scifiscripts.com or http://www.dailyscript.com. Comment - On general principle, none of those places are reliable. If "DailyScript.com" and "SciFiScript.com" are placed to get scripts, then absolutely no. You need to find a source that talks about the script, as the actual script is difficult to authenticate. Unless those other sources have personal interviews they are conducting, then they aren't reliable. Batman-on-film is a fansite. It's like Kryptonsite.com for Smallville. It may be accurate, but it isn't reliable. background:Maroon;color:Gold &amp;BIGNOLE&amp; (Contact me) 23:50, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
Comment: I think that except for SuperHeroHype.com, which is published by Coming Soon Media, L.P. and Crave Online Media, LLC, the other websites are self-published. Per WP:SPS, I don't think that the websites besides SuperHeroHype.com would be acceptable because they're not run by established experts who have been published elsewhere. How dependent is the article on these resources? Perhaps you could find a way to replace the resources: "However, caution should be exercised when using such sources: if the information in question is really worth reporting, someone else is likely to have done so." —Palatino LinotypeErik (talk • contrib) 23:51, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
Well I did fix the sci-fi scripts link because of a script review from IGN. I guess everyone agrees on Superhero Hype! since you guys use it in all of your other articles. background:Maroon;color:Gold &amp;BIGNOLE&amp; said that "unless those other sources have personal interviews they are conducting, then they aren't reliable". Yes, all of those websites have personal interviews they are conducting. So I guess that pretty much solves everything, right? Wildroot (talk) 01:04, 25 October 2008 (UTC) We don't use, or at least we shouldn't, SHH unless they has word-of-mouth information. If they're doing scooper reports, then no..and SHH likes to do a lot of "inside information" reports...just like BOF.com has their "insider" that gives them information. Without specific names of someone they contacted, then it really isn't reliable because rumors are rumors and that is what that information is when someone official has not announced it. background:Maroon;color:Gold &amp;BIGNOLE&amp; (Contact me) 02:26, 26 October 2008 (UTC)It was a Michael Uslan interview. Not "a-I-just-heart-from-one-of-my-inside-sources-at-Warner-Bros." type of report. Wildroot (talk) 02:34, 26 October 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
