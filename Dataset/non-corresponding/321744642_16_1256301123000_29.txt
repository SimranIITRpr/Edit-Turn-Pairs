<edit_text>The phylum was originally called &quot;Polyzoa&quot;, but this term was superseded by &quot;Bryozoa&quot; in 1831. Then a recently-discovered group of animals discovered subsequently, whose filtering mechanism looked similar was also included in &quot;Bryozoa&quot; until 1869, when it was realized that internally the two groups were noted to be very different internally. The more recently discovered group were named Entoprocta, while the original &quot;Bryozoa&quot; were given the name &quot;Ectoprocta&quot;. However, &quot;Bryozoa&quot; has remained the more widely used t<strong><strike>han &amp;quot;Ectoprocta&amp;quot;</strike></strong><strong>erm for the latter group</strong>.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>What classes?</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>The intro says "Some colonies of classes have various types of non-feeding specialist zooids". What does classes mean in this context? In some classes there are species where many individuals form colonies where ...; In some colonies (namely the colonies of particular species) each individual belongs to one of several classes. There are differences in form an function between individuals of different classes. OR ... --Ettrig (talk) 11:45, 23 October 2009 (UTC) Oops, thanks for pointing that out! Is "Colonies of some classes have various types of non-feeding specialist zooids,..." better? --Philcha (talk) 12:20, 23 October 2009 (UTC) This implies that division into types is the same for all species in the class, for all classes. Is this true? --Ettrig (talk) 14:32, 23 October 2009 (UTC)I think the answer may be in the main text, complete with refs - the phrase you rightly questioned was in the lead, which is a ( ? light-weight ?) summary. --Philcha (talk) 15:33, 23 October 2009 (UTC) OK, it seems I must keep reading. Pterobranchs ==&gt; Pterobranches ? This word is linked to a redirect page. Change link to Pterobranchia? --Ettrig (talk) 15:57, 23 October 2009 (UTC) "Pterobranchs" is correct and is the name for the actual animals. "Pterobranchia" is the name of the classification. --Philcha (talk) 18:08, 23 October 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
