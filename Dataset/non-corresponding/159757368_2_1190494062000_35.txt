<edit_text>Rho(D) Immune Globulin antibodies are specific for human Rhesus D (RhD) antigen, also known as Rhesus factor.&lt;ref name= Fung&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These anti-RhD antibodies are known under several brand names, including RhoGAM<strong>, BayRHo-D, Gamulin Rh, HypRho-D, and WinRho SDF</strong>. Rhesus factor is an antigen found on red blood cells; individuals that are Rhesus-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rhesus-negative (Rh-) do not. During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother's system. In the case of an Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; RhoGAM is administered as part of a prenatal treatment regimen to prevent sensitization that may occur when a Rhesus-negative mother has a Rhesus-positive</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Why "Y" shaped</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Just quick question - why are antibodies "Y" shaped. From a layman's perspective, it seems to me that only one half of the Y is need for an antibody to work. That is, it seems to me that only one receptor on one of the arms is needed to binding to the antigen. Does two arms result in a simple doubling the number of binding sites, so as to double the number of "capture site" per molecule, or is there something more subtle to it all? Thanks -- Quantockgoblin 17:11, 16 March 2007 (UTC) There's two quick answers, which I'm unclear how pertinent they'd be to the article, since they're essentially teleologic. 1) Binding of bivalent immunoglobulins of multiple epitope specificities allows for the formation of immune complexes 2) Activation of Fc receptors on effector cells (B cells, macrophages, etc.) may require cross-linking Jbarin 00:42, 7 May 2007 (UTC) -&gt; A third comment should be added to the question: Working with single-chain antibodies – a form of antibodies modified by biotechnological means, which possess only one binding domain - one does observe a significant reduction in the strength of binding of the single-chain antibody to its antigen ias compared with the original antibody having two binding sites - This observation strongly suggests that the two binding sites are also needed to improve the strength of binding.
