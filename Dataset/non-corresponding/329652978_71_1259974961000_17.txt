<edit_comment>/* Plot */  Clarified the plot a little more/ improved wording a bit</edit_comment>
<edit_text>At a ball hosted by Shreck in which Bruce and Selina meet and accidentally discover their dual identities, the Penguin crashes through and a<strong><strike>ttempts to take and kill</strike></strong><strong>nnounces his plan, with</strong> Shreck's beloved son, Chip; in a rare moment of humanity, Shreck insists on being taken instead, and the Penguin reluctantly agrees. Batman, however, stops Cobblepot's men from kidnapping the children and learns where he is hiding. Angered at being foiled once again, Cobblepot resorts to his backup plan: to instead destroy Gotham completely using his penguins to fire missiles into the heart of the city, but Batman, with help from his butler Alfred (Michael Gough), jams the penguins' communicators and makes them return to the sewers.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Christmas film?</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Any idea why this is categorized as a Christmas film? I don't see any real reference to Christmas in the text. I'm currently tagging for the Christmas task force and, maybe, Christmas portal, and wouldn't mind having a GA to add to the portal rotation, but am not sure whether this article really relates to Christmas or not, or even why the category is there. John Carter (talk) 02:02, 5 December 2009 (UTC) Just the plot is happening around the time of christmas and you can see a christmas tree and some presents in it. Nonetheless, I would NOT categorize it as a "christmas movie". If we categorize every movie which shows christmas trees or some part of the plot take place by the time of christmas, we would have to categorize Die Hard as a christmas movie (which someone already did!!). ThatÂ´s quite strange and pointless and has of course nothing to do with christmas movies. Well, some people overdo things! --93.133.215.199 (talk) 11:28, 14 February 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
