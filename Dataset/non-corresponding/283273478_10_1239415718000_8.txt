<edit_text>In addition to shuffling subjects around, USAD has changed the amount of personal research required by students. From the Academic Decathlon's inception until the 1998–99 season, students performed all their own research for each event. Because of this, test writers did not have to base their questions on material USAD published. However, this policy changed at the beginning of the 1999–2000 school year, and required that all test questions come only from USAD materials. With the change in policy came a change in scoring. Records were being set all across the country.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; That year at Nationals, James E. Taylor High School had the highest team score yet seen at the national competition<strong><strike>: 52,470</strike></strong>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the change in requirements for personal research, the coverage of mathematics topics changed. Previously, it was based on the principles of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.&lt;ref name=1998_curriculum /&gt; However, for the 1999,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 2000&lt;ref name=2000_curriculum&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 2001&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; curricula, topics such as fractal geometry, chaotic dynamics, logic and set theory, and general statistics were introduced. In 2002, math returned to its roots and again focused on algebra, geometry, trigonometry while adding differential calculus.&lt;ref name=&quot;2002-2003 Curriculum&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Well, I know USAD no longer has anything about this at usad.org, but for the first two years that they offered Small-School E-Nationals, the guidelines were fewer than 950 students, not &lt; 650. I guess to allow for a broader net? It wasn't until they added the Medium School category that the current school size guidelines were established. I'll look into digging up a source on that one, but if I can't find one, shall I just add it anyway? TechVars (talk) 04:08, 11 April 2009 (UTC) I think it would be best if you found a source for it first. I'll take a look into some of the archives we have used (just take a look at the citations) and hope that some of them mention that. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 15:01, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
