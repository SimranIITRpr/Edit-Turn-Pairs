This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>respected sir/Madam, I have some concepts of black hole which i want to share with every one so please allow me to edit the page to post my view point thak you Raza536 (talk) 06:45, 3 March 2011 (UTC) Raza536 (talk) 06:45, 3 March 2011 (UTC) You would need to suggest specific edits.
