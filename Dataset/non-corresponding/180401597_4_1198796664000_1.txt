<edit_text>When the subsequent plan is put into action, Batman is framed for kidnapping and murder and finds himself trapped in the Batmobile under Penguin's control, barely surviving. Catwoman and Penguin's alliance falls apart when she rebuffs a sexual advance from him, and Penguin opts to kill Catwoman himself. His campaign to recall the current mayor is quickly destroyed when Bruce Wayne plays selected comments he stated while controlling the Batmobile, comments insulting the people of Gotham. The people of Gotham get angry, forcing Penguin to defend himself with his gun umbrella. The police chase after him, but Penguin flees into the sewers, and reveals his secret plan: to kidnap and kill the firstborn sons of Gotham's most prominent families. Bruce meets Selina at a dance party hosted by Shreck, where she reveals to him her intentions to kill Shreck. The two subsequently discover the other's secret identity, but before they can leave to discuss this development, Penguin storms the hall and tries to take Max's son Chip, with Max persuading Penguin to take him instead, and Bruce and Selina depart. Batman, attacks Penguin's Red Triangle Circus goons, and puts a stop to the kidnappings. Penguin then dispatches an army of rocket-armed Penguins to dispatch and bomb Gotham. Batman manages to jam the birds' control signals and turn them around so that they attack the base instead. Fearing that something is amiss, Penguin returns to the Gotham <strong>Zoo </strong>where he encounters Batman. In response Penguin is killed.</edit_text>
