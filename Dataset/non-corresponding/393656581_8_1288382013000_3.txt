<edit_text>Lincoln, the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, Lincoln came under heavy sustained attack from the Radical Republicans, who wanted harsher treatment of the South, from Democrats who wanted more compromise, and from the secessionists who saw him as their <strong><strike>great </strike></strong>enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Tagg, The Unpopular Mr. Lincoln: The Story of America's Most Reviled President (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln fought back with patronage, by pairing his opponents against each other, and by appealing over their heads to the American people, using his powers of oratory,&lt;ref&gt;James G.

It became an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. Lincoln has consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the greatest U.S. Presidents.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Anyone know what page number it is? - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 04:06, 29 October 2010 (UTC) The sentence covers all of 1861-65 as does the book. see the TOC on amazon.com Rjensen (talk) 06:27, 29 October 2010 (UTC)Sounds good. - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 17:51, 29 October 2010 (UTC) Do you know about the Boritt, Gabor S. (1978). Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream. reference? Is it the whole book? - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 21:53, 29 October 2010 (UTC) I just looked at the Boritt book--the chapters are chronological and each one deals with the same themes (like banks and tariffs and RR) at different points in Lincoln's life, so the reference should be to the whole book, not to specific pages.Rjensen (talk) 00:37, 30 October 2010 (UTC) Thanks for the quick replies. Keep an eye out, because I may have another similar question. - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 00:45, 30 October 2010 (UTC) I think this is another one where the whole book is the cite. Not sure. I found pages for the specific dates, times, and number of words. See dif.http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abraham_Lincoln&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=394079692&amp;oldid=394078826 - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 00:52, 1 November 2010 (UTC) I've replaced the Tagg cite- it now references a magazine piece he did covering the point being made in the article and hopefully now we don't have a page problem (I didn't include an external link). I didn't know you were on this, since it wasn't on the GA page. Not too sure about how good a reference Tagg is, but that's another issue.Carmarg4 (talk) 14:17, 9 November 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
