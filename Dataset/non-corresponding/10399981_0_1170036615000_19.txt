<edit_text> For instance, today on ABC she brought up the insightful and telling question of why Barack Obama would travel to Hawaii and not Florida. In displaying her geographic prowess, she conceded Hawaii was a state, but wondered how a presidential candidate would travel to such an exotic place and not Florida.

<turn_topictext>This photo is photoshopped extensively, and given her age must be from 40 years ago. You can tell by the eyes which "bug out" nowadays quite a bit.


The Photo of Ms. Roberts is years old. Wouldn't a more recent photo be appropriate? Like the photo posted on the PBS/Tavis Smiley website on April 30, 2008.

I agree. The picture needs to be updated. 24.17.247.213 (talk) 02:29, 12 August 2008 (UTC)
of course it needs to be updated but this is the only photo available to upload to Wikipedia, those other photos fall under copyright issues, so unless you find a free photo, we are stuck with this one. mijotoba (talk) 15:20, 4 November 2008 (UTC)


The photo in question is clearly a professional portrait, and unless he/she has assigned the copyright, the photographer holds the copyright... so you might have a copy vio after all. â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.88.229.196 (talk) 16:28, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

Well that may be the case, but the picture was available on a website of the federal government and works of the government are in the public domain, and there was no additional mention of a pre-existing copyright or notice to make any other assumptions.
