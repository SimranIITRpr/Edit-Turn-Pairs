<edit_text>All clergy appointments are made and fixed annually by the Resident Bishop on the advice of the Annual Conference Cabinet, which is composed of the Area Provost/Dean (if one is appointed) and the several District Superintendents of the Districts of the Annual Conference. Until the Bishop has read the appointments at the session of the Annual Conference, no appointments are officially fixed. Many Annual Conferences try to avoid making appointment changes between sessions of Annual Conference. While an appointment is made one year at a time, it is most common for an appointment to be continued for multiple years. One recent survey concluded that small church appointments currently average three to four years, while large church appointments average seven to nine years. Appointment tenures in extension ministries, such as<strong> Military Chaplaincy,</strong> Campus Ministry, Missions, Higher Education and other ministries beyond the local church are often even longer. Across the denomination, longer tenures are becoming more common.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Should something be added about how the UMC allows votive candles and the performance of the sign of the cross? Tarheelz123 (talk) 22:59, 1 June 2009 (UTC) When and where? Neither of these practices is an official or unofficial practice in the United Methodist Church. While converts from other Anglo-Catholic traditions may continue these practices from their previous faith tradition, they simply are not part of the United Methodist practice of faith. Revmqo (talk) 11:44, 23 June 2009 (UTC) That is a really misleading title "semi-catholic traditions." There are many traditions (Anglicanism, Lutheranism, Orthodoxy) that follow those practices. I don't think those need to be mentioned in the article itself, however. KitHutch (talk) 17:42, 24 June 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
