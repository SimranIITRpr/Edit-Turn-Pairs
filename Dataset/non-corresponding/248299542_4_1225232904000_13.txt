<edit_text>During production, Peters read in the The Wall Street Journal that comic book fans were unsatisfied with the casting of Michael Keaton. In response, Peters rushed out the first trailer that played in thousands of theaters during Christmas. The trailer was simply a surreal assemblage of scenes without music<strong><strike>.

<turn_topicname>Reliable Sources</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Before I take this article to Featured Article Candidacy, I have to prove that the following websites are reliable sources: http://www.superherohype.com
http://www.snarkygossip.com
http://www.dailyscript.com
http://www.batmanytb.com
http://www.batman-on-film.com
http://www.scifiscripts.com
Since I have no way of explaining this, other than Being Bold, it's probably best to collect other opinions from editors. http://www.superherohype.com because it has its own page at Superhero Hype!, it that makes any sense. Batman-on-Film might pass since "Batman-related" filmmakers such as David Goyer, Michael Uslan and Chris Corbould call call it reliable. And nice. However, the other websites might be a little tricky. Alientraveller said it's good to only use sites like those for interviews and set visits, when information comes directly from the source. Then again, the doesn't explain http://www.scifiscripts.com or http://www.dailyscript.com. Comment - On general principle, none of those places are reliable. If "DailyScript.com" and "SciFiScript.com" are placed to get scripts, then absolutely no. You need to find a source that talks about the script, as the actual script is difficult to authenticate. Unless those other sources have personal interviews they are conducting, then they aren't reliable. Batman-on-film is a fansite. It's like Kryptonsite.com for Smallville. It may be accurate, but it isn't reliable. background:Maroon;color:Gold &amp;BIGNOLE&amp; (Contact me) 23:50, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
Comment: I think that except for SuperHeroHype.com, which is published by Coming Soon Media, L.P. and Crave Online Media, LLC, the other websites are self-published. Per WP:SPS, I don't think that the websites besides SuperHeroHype.com would be acceptable because they're not run by established experts who have been published elsewhere. How dependent is the article on these resources? Perhaps you could find a way to replace the resources: "However, caution should be exercised when using such sources: if the information in question is really worth reporting, someone else is likely to have done so." —Palatino LinotypeErik (talk • contrib) 23:51, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
Well I did fix the sci-fi scripts link because of a script review from IGN. I guess everyone agrees on Superhero Hype! since you guys use it in all of your other articles. background:Maroon;color:Gold &amp;BIGNOLE&amp; said that "unless those other sources have personal interviews they are conducting, then they aren't reliable". Yes, all of those websites have personal interviews they are conducting. So I guess that pretty much solves everything, right? Wildroot (talk) 01:04, 25 October 2008 (UTC) We don't use, or at least we shouldn't, SHH unless they has word-of-mouth information. If they're doing scooper reports, then no..and SHH likes to do a lot of "inside information" reports...just like BOF.com has their "insider" that gives them information. Without specific names of someone they contacted, then it really isn't reliable because rumors are rumors and that is what that information is when someone official has not announced it. background:Maroon;color:Gold &amp;BIGNOLE&amp; (Contact me) 02:26, 26 October 2008 (UTC)It was a Michael Uslan interview. Not "a-I-just-heart-from-one-of-my-inside-sources-at-Warner-Bros." type of report. Wildroot (talk) 02:34, 26 October 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
