<turn_topicname>Mertens-Cage interview about Branca</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>I have twice removed the paragraph in which Cage is supposed to be telling Mertens bad things about Branca's work Indeterminate Activity of Resultant Masses. I felt the added bit was not very revealing about Cage and that it was added in order to bring Branca forward, a tactic which is defined and discouraged at WP:Coatrack. If there were a quoted sentence or two from Cage which showed how he felt about Branca or his piece then the whole bit would be of much greater value. Binksternet (talk) 20:10, 23 December 2008 (UTC) I agree. SethTisue (talk) 13:57, 25 December 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
