<edit_text>Objective events
In general, the objective events follow a set organizational outline from year to year. Language and Literature focuses on a main novel or a set of plays in addition to multiple short selections which tend to be poems or excerpts from short stories. The Art and Music sections include several selections which students must familiarize themselves with in addition to historical information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Art 2008-2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Music 2008-2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Economics remains fairly static; 85% focuses on a standard course of macroeconomics and microeconomics.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the remaining 15% on the year's topic. For example, in the 2005 theme &quot;Exploring the Ancient World&quot;, this 15% dealt with the economics of ancient Egypt and Rome. The Math curriculum, which includes general math, geometry, trigonometry, and differential calculus,&lt;ref name=theme2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; has remained constant since 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;2002-2003 Curriculum&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Theme 2009-2010&quot; /&gt; Science and Social Science change completely each season and depend on that year's theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theme 2009-2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Theme 2007-2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;<strong><strike> Unlike the other events, there is no basic information that carries over.</strike></strong><strong>&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.usad.org/terry/outlines_2008_2009/science_outline.asp|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usad.org%2Fterry%2Foutlines_2008_2009%2Fscience_outline.asp&amp;date= March 2, 2009|title= United States Academic Decathlon : Science Curriculum Outline:|accessdate= March 2, 2009|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|archivedate= March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;</strong></edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Medals Image</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Well, it's pretty well-known that all states use different medals. However, since this is the United States Academic Decathlon article, would it be better to instead use a picture of say, a bronze, silver &amp; gold medal from USAD itself? I know that the E-Nationals medals are the same as the Nationals medals, and I've taken at least one in every category. I could take a picture of them, and upload them to Wikimedia, if that would be helpful.autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by TechVars (talk • contribs) You know, that would be great. Do you think you could add the images? And if you have access to the medals with you, do you think you could get gold, silver, and bronze all in one shot? That would be greatly appreciated. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 03:39, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
