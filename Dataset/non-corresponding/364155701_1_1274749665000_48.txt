<turn_topictext>Canada doesn't have and never has had Marines. Admittedly, there is some confusion as the Navy is often referred to as "Marine" in French, but if one is speak of a detached body of sailors, in English, they are referred to as "sailors", and not "marines". I think the idea of the example is valid (ie. to explain a detached body), but the terminology would lead to confusion. Anyone have any better ways to phrase it?
