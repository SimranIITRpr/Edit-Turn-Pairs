<turn_topicname>Use of the word "enriched"</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>To the lay(ish) reader (me) this bit confused me at first. Given that we are talking about B10 and B11 to use the word enriched boron for B10 and depleted boron for B11 is counter-intuitive with out a close read of the article and even then some might miss it. At first read I am thinking how can 10 be greater than 11? IE we are talking about a process that alters the natural abundances of the two isotopes. To talk about 'enriched' boron is also a bit silly, can it be humored as well? Seeing as this page is "semi protected" I suggest changing the title Enriched boron (boron-10) To Boron Enrichment As what this section is really talking about is not just boron BUT really a process for the purpose of producing a product for either the nuclear industry or the space industry. IT may then be possible to combine the two sections (ie Enriched boron (boron-10) and Depleted boron (boron-11) with a discussion of the direction of enrichment of the different isotopes for different end uses. You can then link off to Isotopic Separation (which I note used to be Isotopic Enrichment - maybe the same discussion was had?) And really, why would you call it Depleted boron (B11) when it is the most abundant isotope as stated in the article! Another potentially misleading use of the word depleted for the lay reader? What you are saying is that the isotope used in these space applications (B11)is the product that remains after the B10 has been removed. Now 'enriched', surely? Really, ask yourself the question which one we would call enriched and depleted if the first use of Boron was spacecraft and not nuclear reactors? And there are currently more spacecraft than nuclear reactors anyway.... IF NEEDED maybe state that B10 is commonly referred to in the Nuclear Industry as enriched Boron.
