<turn_topicname>missing illustration?</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>The last paragraph of the section Microscopic structure refers to an "illustration on the right" which seems to have gone missing.

I've looked back through the page history, and it wasn't deleted by mistake any time recently. I'll correct the text. Thanks for finding that! --Tryptofish (talk) 00:56, 15 September 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
