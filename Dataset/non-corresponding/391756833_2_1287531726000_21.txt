<edit_text>Burton became attached as director, while <strong><strike>producer</strike></strong><strong>[[film producer|producer]]</strong> Denise Di Novi and writer Daniel Waters also returned to the Catwoman spin-off with Burton.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct Catwoman or an adaptation of The Fall of the House of Usher.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his Catwoman script to Warner Bros., the same day Batman Forever was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, &quot;turning it in the day Batman Forever opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. Catwoman is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer getting replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically-panned Catwoman (2004) starring Halle Berry.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>If there are reliable, verifiable sources for both versions of wht Burton didn't direct the next film, both version should be in the article. Wikipedia doesn't get to push one version over the other. - J Greb (talk) 01:42, 20 October 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
<turn_text>The plot "summary" seems excessively detailed (and very poorly written). I was unable to locate the correct location to read up on the guidelines for plot summaries, so this is just my gut level feeling on it. autosignedâ€”Preceding unsigned comment added by </turn_text>
