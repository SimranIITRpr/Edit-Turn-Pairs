<edit_text>2000–2001
The 2000–01 season witnessed many changes to USAD. The program's executive director of four years, James Alvino, resigned.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; after a ontroversy broke regarding a religious article Alvino had written a<strong><strike>nd</strike></strong><strong> religious article that</strong> had been included in that year's Super Quiz Resource Guide. Alvino stated, &quot;I think that misunderstandings surrounding that article helped precipitate these actions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; USAD also altered their testing policies: 50% of test questions were to come from USAD published &quot;Resource Guides&quot; and 50% were to come from unspecified sources. Before the 2000 season, students had to do all of their research independently; in 2000 they did not have to independently research anything.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Economics focused on business organizations and profiles in individual enterprise rather than macroeconomics and microeconomics as it had for the previous 19 years. A decrease in scores followed these changes; the national winner that year, El Camino Real High School, had a score of 5,923 points fewer than the score put up by James E. Taylor High School, the previous year's winner.&lt;ref name=2001_nats&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000–01 season was also significant in that it was the first year that states were allowed to send both their large and small school champions to the national competition.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, this practice was short-lived and was discontinued after the 2002 season. Instead, a small school e-Nationals was introduced during the 2005–06 school year.&lt;ref name=2006_ss_results&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The medium school e-Nationals was established two years later.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Medals Image</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Well, it's pretty well-known that all states use different medals. However, since this is the United States Academic Decathlon article, would it be better to instead use a picture of say, a bronze, silver &amp; gold medal from USAD itself? I know that the E-Nationals medals are the same as the Nationals medals, and I've taken at least one in every category. I could take a picture of them, and upload them to Wikimedia, if that would be helpful.autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by TechVars (talk • contribs) You know, that would be great. Do you think you could add the images? And if you have access to the medals with you, do you think you could get gold, silver, and bronze all in one shot? That would be greatly appreciated. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 03:39, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
