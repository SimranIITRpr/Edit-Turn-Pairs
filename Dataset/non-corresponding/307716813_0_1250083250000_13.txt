<edit_comment>/* Fossil record */ probably the first bryozoans were entirely soft-bodied</edit_comment>
<edit_text><strong>Since all the other phyla that have left fossils are found in [[Cambrian]] rocks, it is slightly surprisng that the earliest bryozoan fossil dates from the Ordovician, which immediately followed the Cambrian. Most probably the first bryozoans were entirely soft-bodied, and the Ordovician fossils record the appearance of mineralized skeletons in this phylum.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;FuchsObstSundberg2009ComprMolPhyloOfBryozoa&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Evolutionary family tree
A study in 2009, using a combination of genes from mitochondia and the cell nucleus, concluded that Bryozoa is a monophyletic phylum, in other words includes all the descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a member of the same group. The analysis also concluded that the classes Phylactolaemata, Stenolaemata and Gymnolaemata are also monophyletic, but could not determine whether Stenolaemata are more closely related to Phylactolaemata or Gymnolaemata. The Gymnolaemata are traditionally divided into the soft-bodied Ctenostomata and mineralized Cheilostomata, but the 2009 analysis considered it more likely that neither of these orders is monophyletic and that mineralized skeletons probably evolved more than once within the early Gymnolaemata.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuchsObstSundberg2009ComprMolPhyloOfBryozoa&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>"[edit] Interaction with humans Bryozoa Bryozoa generally do not interact with humans as something of a rule. This is due to a longstanding feud with humans after an incident in 1922 when a colony of Bryozoa were involved in a scuffle with an unknown man over a disagreement regarding coleslaw. Charles McRogersonstone - a member of the colony - was quoted after the incident as saying It was truly awful. I had no idea that soggy carrot could inflict such damage.
