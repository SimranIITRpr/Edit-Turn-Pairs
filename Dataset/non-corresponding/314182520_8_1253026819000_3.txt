<edit_comment>/* Brain and mind */</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Through most of history many philosophers found it inconceivable that cognition could be implemented by a physical substance such as brain tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Neurophilosophy, Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers such as Patricia Churchland posit that the drug-mind interaction is indicative of an intimate connection between the brain and the mind, not that the two are the same entity.&lt;ref&gt;Neurophilosophy, Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Even Descartes, notable for his mechanistic philosophy<strong><strike> which</strike></strong><strong>, who</strong> found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in mechanistic terms, could not believe that complex thought, language in particular, could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone.&lt;ref&gt;1988.

<turn_topicname>unclear sentence?</turn_topicname>
