<edit_text><strong><strike>=== Water ===
</strike></strong><strong>;Water 
</strong>Beer is composed mostly of water. Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character.&lt;ref name=&quot;geot&quot;/&gt; For example, Dublin has hard water well suited to making stout, such as Guinness; while Pilzen has soft water well suited to making pale lager, such as Pilsner Urquell.&lt;ref name=&quot;geot&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as Burtonisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000098.html Michael Jackson, BeerHunter, 19 October 1991, Brewing a good glass of water.

<turn_topicname>Brewdog has just released a 55% alcohol beer.</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Also, some discussion should be devoted to the difference between percentage by volume and by weight, and the conversion of these two numbers. In several states, including Oklahoma and Utah, it's illegal to sell chilled beer that is over 3.2% ABV. To get beer of higher alcohol content, one must go to a "liquor store" or "package store", which, in the case of Utah, are all owned by the state. At these establishments, the beer, wine, and spirits are sold at room temperature. Also, federal law states that no alcoholic beverage over 4% ABW (alcohol by weight) may be labeled as Beer, thus the rise of the term "Malt Liquor" to denote high alcohol American-style beers. This is also why many microbrewed beers sold by the bottle are labeled with their style, such as Pale Ale, Stout, Porter, etc., rather than with the word "beer". font-size: smaller;autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.185.216.18 (talk) 16:34, 23 July 2010 (UTC) That is an interesting point about the selling of beer in the USA. Should we have a section about beer in different parts of the world, so we can cover location-specifics such as this? Similar to how beers above 10% are usually marketed as barley wines over here. font-size: smaller;autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by 80.6.35.235 (talk) 22:18, 5 August 2010 (UTC) holds articles that talk about alcohol measurement. There's an article about Alcohol by volume, though not one about ABW. I think there is a need for an overall article about alcohol measurement. This article wouldn't really be the appropriate place to start that, as this is about beer, rather than alcohol measurement.
