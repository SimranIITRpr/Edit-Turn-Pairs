<edit_text>}} The United Methodist Church is a Methodist Christian denomination which is both [[Mainline (Protestant)<strong><strike>|mainline</strike></strong>]] and evangelical. It traces its roots back to the holiness reform movement of John and Charles Wesley&lt;ref name=&quot;UMCofWB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; within the Anglican Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Methodist Central Hall Westminster—Methodism&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Service Projects—Holiness Movement&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the church's theological orientation is decidedly Wesleyan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longhenry-Wesleyanism&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It contains both liturgical and evangelical elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC-Evangelical&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EPPC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it ranks as the largest mainline denomination, the second largest Protestant church after the Southern Baptist Convention, and the third largest Christian denomination. As of 2007, worldwide membership was about 12 million: 8.0 million in the United States and Canada,&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 3.5 million in Africa, Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Christian Post&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the World Council of Churches, the World Methodist Council, and other religious associations.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>I know this is a minor issue, but I do not see why mainline is referred to as "mainline (Protestant)" in the article. The Wikipedia article uses the disambiguator because there are other uses for the word. However, in an article about a mainline Protestant denomination, there is no need for a disambiguator. If someone doesn't know what the term means, then odds are the disambiguator wouldn't help anyway, that's why the word is linked to the Mainline (Protestant) article. Ltwin (talk) 01:10, 20 January 2010 (UTC) I agree with you and removed the disambiguator. Other US Protestant denominations don not have it it their articles. KitHutch (talk) 19:30, 20 January 2010 (UTC) It seems the disambiguator was put back in and I reverted it again explaining my reason in the edit summary. However, let me explain it further. One reason against arbitrarily disambiguating everything in the article is that it becomes horrible to read, with parentheses everywhere a term with one or more uses is introduced. Another reason is that in an article about a Protestant denomination, adding (Protestant) behind mainline is redundant. Ltwin (talk) 23:01, 20 January 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
