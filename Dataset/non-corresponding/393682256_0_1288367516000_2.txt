<edit_text>Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and, after more dedicated self-study, as county surveyor.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, he won election to the state legislature after a bipartisan campaign, though he ran as Whig.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He then decided to become a lawyer, and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England and other<strong><strike> master</strike></strong>s. Lincoln's description of his learning method was: &quot;I studied with nobody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln (1992), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to practice law under John T. Stuart, Mary Todd's cousin.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 71, 79, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. In 1841, he partnered with Stephen Logan until 1844, when he began his practice with William Herndon, whom Lincoln thought &quot;a studious young man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 67–69, pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 67–69 pp. 75, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Anyone know what page number it is? - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 04:06, 29 October 2010 (UTC) The sentence covers all of 1861-65 as does the book. see the TOC on amazon.com Rjensen (talk) 06:27, 29 October 2010 (UTC)Sounds good. - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 17:51, 29 October 2010 (UTC) Do you know about the Boritt, Gabor S. (1978). Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream. reference? Is it the whole book? - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 21:53, 29 October 2010 (UTC) I just looked at the Boritt book--the chapters are chronological and each one deals with the same themes (like banks and tariffs and RR) at different points in Lincoln's life, so the reference should be to the whole book, not to specific pages.Rjensen (talk) 00:37, 30 October 2010 (UTC) Thanks for the quick replies. Keep an eye out, because I may have another similar question. - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 00:45, 30 October 2010 (UTC) I think this is another one where the whole book is the cite. Not sure. I found pages for the specific dates, times, and number of words. See dif.http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abraham_Lincoln&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=394079692&amp;oldid=394078826 - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 00:52, 1 November 2010 (UTC) I've replaced the Tagg cite- it now references a magazine piece he did covering the point being made in the article and hopefully now we don't have a page problem (I didn't include an external link). I didn't know you were on this, since it wasn't on the GA page. Not too sure about how good a reference Tagg is, but that's another issue.Carmarg4 (talk) 14:17, 9 November 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
