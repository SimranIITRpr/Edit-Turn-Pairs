The agreement between the Pirates and the Magallanes Navigators allowed the participation of the prospectus buccaneer in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. With barely 21 years, Bonds came out for the first time U.S. to wear the shirt of one of the most popular clubs in the country. "It was a kind and very quiet worker, for anything problematic," recalled Gregorio Machado, coach of MAgallenes (turks ship) at that time. "He came to work on the run in the foundation and its fildeo." "It was not very sociable. It was very quiet, "added the coach, who said that the young American" who was not going to be a phenomenon, but it had potential, because he was a player of great projection. " Angel Escobar, the first bat of that club magallanero Bonds described as "a skinny body with athletic," which "had a level of maturity in his game." "He was a simple person, very focused on their things, not selfish, but very involved in what I had to do," said the former grandeliga Creole. "I shared a lot with him and saw that it was a person with a lot of confidence in itself." Despite that nobody had a complaint from him, Bonds went home before the campaign leading 85-86, leaving average of .244 (160-39), with 32 scored, eight doubles, a triple, seven home runs, 23 Towed and seven swindled in 44 commitments. "We surprised a lot to leave, because he was performing. I suppose to be the first choice for the Pirates in the draft had something to do, "said Escobar. "He had some discomfort in his shoulder and following the launch of it went," said Machado. "In addition, it was the first time I was away from home, I was very young, and already agreed to leave in December to be with his family at Christmas." Its passage through Venezuela left him very good impression of Latino ballplayers, with whom he has taken well, even after being a superstar. "With me were ported from the best," said via telephone from the U.S., Wilson Alvarez, who shared with the gardener in San Francisco in 1997. "With Latinos, and in general with their peers is good, what happens is another impression because it creates a lot of pressure and has as many eyes on him, sometimes reflected, as it puts a shield, and cares." Alvarez, who describes the jonronero as "the best hitter in the Major Leagues," said that during the year of his retirement in 2005, requested an autographed suvenir. "I told him, 'Look, I would have signed something of yours,' and the same bat he used in the game I signed it and told me, 'takes, here it is'. He wrote: 'For Wilson, God bless you,' and I signed it, "recalled. font-size: smaller;autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by 205.217.249.136 (talk) 17:15, 4 December 2008 (UTC) The next to last clause in the following sentence in the introduction goes beyond being misleading and is factually false. "In 2007, he was indicted for perjury and obstruction of justice concerning the government investigation of BALCO, and despite DNA evidence linking him to performance-enhancing drugs and the BALCO labs, jury selection has been postponed indefinitely." There is no "DNA evidence". What there is is "disputed drug tests". If there was "DNA evidence" that linked Barry Bonds to these drug tests the defense team would not have been able to get the judge to exclude them and the prosecution team would thus not need to be appealing to have them reinstated. These "drug tests" were excluded because the prosecution did not have a witness with direct knowledge (non Hearsay) that was willing to say that these tests were of blood or urine samples provided by Barry Bonds. If "DNA evidence" of this existed the prosecution would not need such a witness and the judge would not have excluded these "disputed drug tests". giantsrainman (talk) 13:23, 19 January 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
