<turn_topicname>Who is this andy reid?</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>when searching for andy reid, the page that appears should be for the footballer (soccer player), i am sure he is of more note and fame than this bloke, seriously wee cares about some yank fella. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Jamboertoot (talk • contribs) 19:24, 31 October 2009 (UTC)

It is indeed daft. I've never heard of this man either. It should at least be straight to disambig, there is no way he is so famous he dwarves a international footballer.--130.243.175.252 (talk) 12:15, 8 November 2009 (UTC)

Agreed. Though I don't know the criteria for picking a dominant Andy Reid. Balfa (talk) 23:47, 9 November 2009 (UTC)
I don't know such criteria either, but there is a disambiguation page through which you can get to Andy Reid the footballer (soccer player).</turn_topictext>
