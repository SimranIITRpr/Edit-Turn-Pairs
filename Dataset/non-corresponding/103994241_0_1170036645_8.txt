<turn_topictext>Is it really sure that Ivory Coast is the best 4th placed team in the classification groups and South Korea the best 3rd place team in the classification groups? I think this is premature.--Anaxagoras13 (talk) 10:48, 8 September 2019 (UTC)

For that matter, as I look at it this instant, I don't think Tunisia has clinched their position yet either; they're 3-2 and at least either China or Nigeria could also get to 3-2. MrArticleOne (talk) 12:48, 8 September 2019 (UTC)
Several other teams in the groups that play tomorrow could also get to 3-2.</turn_topictext>
