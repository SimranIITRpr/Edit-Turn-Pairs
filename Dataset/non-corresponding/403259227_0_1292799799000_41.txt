<edit_comment>/* Legacy and memorials */  Edward should be Edwin</edit_comment>
<edit_text>President Lincoln's assassination and death immediately made him a national martyr and myth. To abolitionists, Lincoln was viewed as champion for &quot;human liberty&quot;. Lincoln was even equated as a Christ-like martyr since he was assassinated on Good Friday. Radical Republicans seized the opportunity over Lincoln's death as a justification for harsher measures against the south that Lincoln had himself been opposed too. Secretary of State Edw<strong><strike>ard</strike></strong><strong>in</strong> Stanton, in charge of Lincoln's funeral train, used Lincoln's body to encourage public support in the North for stronger measures against the South. From President Grant to President McKinley, Lincoln's name was linked with the Republican party and synomous for &quot;freedom and union&quot; during national elections. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.&lt;ref&gt;Chesebrough, pp. 76, 79, 106, 110; Current (1988), The Lincoln Nobody Knows, pp. 282-284&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Sec of State Edward or Edwin Stanton is not correct. William H. Seward was Sec of State. Could someone look up who is being refered to.--Javaweb (talk) 00:03, 20 December 2010 (UTC)Javaweb It was Stanton; (Seward was a moderate who supported Lincoln's policies). Anyway the point lacks a RS and is not needed; Stanton was one of many Radical republicans who used Lincoln's death as a political weapon against the South. Rjensen (talk) 00:52, 20 December 2010 (UTC)Yes. If I put Seward in, then that was a mistake. The source mentioned Stanton. Cmguy777 (talk) 23:48, 20 December 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
