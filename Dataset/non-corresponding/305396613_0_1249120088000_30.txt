<edit_text>}} The Victoria Cross () is a military decoration of Canada modelled on the original British Victoria Cross instituted in 1856 in both intent and appearance, though with several small changes. Created in 1993, it and the original are the highest honours in the Canadian honours system, taking precedence over all other orders, decorations, and medals. It is awarded by either the Canadian monarch or his or her viceregal representative, the Governor General of Canada, to any member of the Canadian Forces or allies serving under or with Canadian military command for extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing a hostile force. Whereas in many other Commonwealth countries, the Victoria Cross can only be awarded for actions against the enemy in a wartime setting, the Canadian government has a broader definition of the term enemy, and so the Victoria Cross can be awarded for action against armed mutineers, pirates, or other such hostile forces without war being officially declared. Recipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters VC (for both English and French), and also to an annual annuity of C$3,000.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Reynolds| first=Ken| title=Pro Valore: Canada's Victoria Cross| place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| page=40| edition=2| url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/pub/boo-bro/vc-cv/doc/vc-cv-eng.pdf| accessdate=31 July 2009<strong>| ref=CITEREF_Reynolds</strong>}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; The Victoria Cross can be awarded more than once, but no one has received the Canadian medal since its inception.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Notes (of the foot type and others)</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>I've retitled the notes and footnotes sections as per WP:REFNOTE, which states, in particular, that "A separate section containing references is usually given the title 'References', while the explanatory notes section retains the 'Notes' title." As for the bibliography, as I explained in my edit summary, its contents are not, as far as I can tell, references for the article, but are instead there for further reading on the subject; I removed from that section books that are already present in the references. --border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%background-color:black;color:whiteĦ color:blackMIESIANIACAL 11:48, 1 August 2009 (UTC) While this wasn't one of the recent changes, is there any reason why all the refs and notes are enclosed in "small" html tags. I don't know of any other article that does this, it makes them quite hard to read on my monitor. David Underdown (talk) 09:24, 3 August 2009 (UTC)In terms of the footnotes, Miesianiacal and I had a http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Miesianiacal&amp;oldid=305449131#Canadian about it. In terms of "small" that is part of ; use large font. Reflist seems to have become the standard use due to the sheer size of the references if they are in large font on articles such as Victoria Cross where there are over 80 references. Regards, Woody (talk) 12:03, 3 August 2009 (UTC)I think we're slightly at cross-purposes, the first time a reference appears, looking in edit mode I see every other usage of the ref tag also seems to be enclosed in small tags. This makes the [1] and so on you get for each reference exceedingly small and difficult to read. David Underdown (talk) 16:19, 3 August 2009 (UTC)Ah, Oui, Je comprends, so I have removed them. I could see no reason for them and I think they go against WP:ACCESSIBILITY. Regards, Woody (talk) 16:34, 3 August 2009 (UTC)I'm not seeing how it's so small as to be difficult to read; in fact, as I noted at my talkpage, it's the present arragement, wherein baseline spacing is uneven - a rather big no-no in print typesetting - depending on the presence or absence of an inline reference tag, that makes the article(s) difficult for me to read. This appears as such on all screens I use. I'll try to get some screenshots later (this is a somewhat new computer I'm using). --border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%background-color:black;color:whiteĦ color:blackMIESIANIACAL 13:26, 4 August 2009 (UTC)If there's an issue with the standard ref tags, it would be better to get them fixed at source, project wide. Adopting ad hoc fixes for individual articles simply makes editing harder. You may find it OK, but I was struggling, and though I routinely wear glasses, my sight only needs minimal correction. David Underdown (talk) 13:54, 4 August 2009 (UTC)I attempted that, but received no assistance. --border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%background-color:black;color:whiteĦ color:blackMIESIANIACAL 18:52, 4 August 2009 (UTC) To offer another explanation: I've restored my note format, as it automatically numbers the notes, as opposed to Woody's method, which requires manual tracking to make sure a note's number matches the order of its corresponding inline tag. --border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%background-color:black;color:whiteĦ color:blackMIESIANIACAL 19:55, 4 August 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
