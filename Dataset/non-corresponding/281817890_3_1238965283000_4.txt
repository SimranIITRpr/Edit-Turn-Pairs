<turn_topictext>suggested that the following ought to be added to the article. Since I don't have access to actual paper newspapers, these are the best I could find:

There is also concern that the competitions take up too much time. The National Association of Secondary School Principals, which publishes an annual list of contests and activities, does not endorse national contests that require team competition at a common site.'We do discourage national competitions of all kinds, said Scott D. Thomson, executive director of the association. They draw too much of the students' time and attention away from their regular schoolwork, But he added that the association did not object to the competitions themselves. We're opposed to the national dimension of it, Mr. Thomson said, not the academic competition dimension of it."

Anything else along these lines that people could think of? Criticisms of USAD is probably the only real thing missing from this article; a prose cleanup would be enough to get this article to FA. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 03:11, 4 April 2009 (UTC) About that LA Times article...I think that might be right here:http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/12/local/me-18619 I also found a few articles discussing that year's...issues. http://acadectalk.com/index.php?showtopic=3757 - Time, http://acadectalk.com/index.php?showtopic=3757 - Editorial by Larry Jones, posted on ADT by a decathlete from PA. I'm looking for the original source. TechVars (talk) 04:27, 11 April 2009 (UTC)Found the original source of the Larry Jones editorial. http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/23/local/me-22633 - shocker, LA Times. TechVars (talk) 04:33, 11 April 2009 (UTC)Thanks, those are really good. I incorporated those into the article. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 17:13, 11 April 2009 (UTC)
