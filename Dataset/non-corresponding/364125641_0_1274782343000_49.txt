<turn_topicname>Original lede: "The Canadian medal may be awarded more than once, however nobody has received it since its inception".  Cart before the horse?</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Surely by far the most important point is that nobody has ever been awarded the medal? That it can be awarded more than once is surely an academic point that doesn't belong in the lede, let alone as a non-sequitur introduction to the key point. I have deleted the "may be awarded twice" bit from the lede: if frequent editors believe it is a critical inclusion then at least reword it so that it follows the key point, not introduces it! --John Maynard Friedman (talk) 12:12, 25 May 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
