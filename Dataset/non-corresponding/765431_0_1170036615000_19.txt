Comment SB Nation is a blog site, but that's a pretty hefty fine so I'm sure there are more reliable sources out there covering this. Lizard (talk) 22:50, 15 September 2016 (UTC)
ABC News, CBS Sports. I'm currently on mobile though away from home so I don't have time to put it into the article. Lizard (talk) 22:53, 15 September 2016 (UTC)
Additional comment: I would agree to both sources, and the one from sports nation as well. If someone approves of this, it just might silently accept this edit request and put all three references in while updating the article. The fine sure looks hefty for dancing in celebration. 50.29.199.144 (talk) 01:30, 17 September 2016 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
