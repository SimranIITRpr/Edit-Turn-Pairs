<edit_text><strong><strike>====Mitigation of gastrointestinal bleeding====
</strike></strong>In addition to enteric coating, &quot;buffering&quot; is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent that is used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses MgO. Other preparations use CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/acidbase/faq/buffered-aspirin.shtml&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;</edit_text>
