The display aircraft, named &quot;The Spirit of Delta&quot; by the employees who helped purchase it in 1982, is undergoing restoration at the Delta Air Lines Air Transport Heritage Museum in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;<strong> Featuring the original delivered interior as well as historical displays, the aircraft is viewable by Delta employees and the general public by appointment.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url= http://blog.seattlepi.com/airlinereporter/archives/224585.asp|title=The Spirit of Delta Air Lines: The gift of a Boeing 767|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=January 19, 2011|date=October 13, 2010

<turn_topictext>User:Sp33dyphil started a peer review for this article. Check on the page and help make improvements suggested. Thanks for any help. -fnlayson (talk) 17:33, 17 January 2011 (UTC) This article should be ready for a GA review after this. It is too big of a hurtle to go straight for FA. -fnlayson (talk) 22:24, 17 January 2011 (UTC) Overall, seems to be pretty improved, and I think worthy of GA consideration. The prose is generally consistent, the article is factually verifiable, has broad coverage, neutral, stable, and illustrated. The review was helpful in illuminating issues to improve. One difference though, captions have been trimmed for spacing. For further work, a key issue but nitpicky/cumbersome is consistency of referencing (which I have gone through many times on other articles, fortunately some bots now help out). Retrieved by dates, italics on "Flight Global" vs. "Flight International" etc. US style vs. EU dates. For higher status that needs to be worked out. Besides that issue, perhaps there are areas where claims could be challenged for refs, the prose improved or flow bettered, but that varies by reviewer. SynergyStar (talk) 03:21, 21 January 2011 (UTC) I list Flightglobal.com or Flight International depending on which is listed on the article page. I believe FI is listed if the article appears in the print magazine. -fnlayson (talk) 05:03, 21 January 2011 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
