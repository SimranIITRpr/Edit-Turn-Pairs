<edit_text>Some amino acids have even been detected in meteorites, especially in a type known as carbonaceous chondrites.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This observation has prompted the suggestion that life may have arrived on earth from an extraterrestrial source. The Murchison meteorite is especially rich in amino acids and other organic matter<strong> i like boys</strong>.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Presentation College,There is one querry that i have . Cystein , as an amino acid ... is it Polar ? I have a text book by Richard Kent which argues thet it is Non Polar ... â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 190.58.4.66 (talk) 04:40, 16 October 2007 (UTC) It is non-polar when protonated but polar when ionised. Tim Vickers 18:03, 4 December 2007 (UTC) No, its not polar in its non-ionised form. S-H and C-H bond are pretty similar. Narayanese (talk) 21:42, 19 October 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
