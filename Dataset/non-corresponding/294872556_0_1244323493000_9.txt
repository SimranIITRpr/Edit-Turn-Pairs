<edit_text>According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be <strong><strike>incur full the punishment for</strike></strong><strong>both an act of</strong> killing according to the Vinaya, the Buddhist code of monastic rules. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the perception of the presence of the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death.&lt;ref&gt;Hammalawa Saddhatissa, Buddhist Ethics. Wisdom Publications, 1997, pages 60, 159, see also Bartholomeusz page 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mv.VIII.61, Buddhist Monastic code chapter 8, Pacittiya. http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc1/ch08-7.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, In Defense of Dharma. RoutledgeCurzon 2002, page 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to save, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, In Defense of Dharma. RoutledgeCurzon 2002, pages 44, 121-122, 124, .&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>I'm not sure what you mean with this edit summary: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ahimsa&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=294740055. The statement in it is not correct. Please give the Lamotte quote and we can settle it that way. Also the Vinaya is not relevant in the "war" subsection. There are no "punishments" for laypeople.
