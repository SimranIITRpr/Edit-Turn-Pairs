<edit_text>'Anna May Wong''' ([[January 3]], [[1905]] &amp;ndash; [[February 2]], [[1961]]) was an [[United States|American]] 

[[actor|actress]], the first [[Chinese American]] [[movie star]], and the first female Asian American star. Her screen career 

spanned the [[silent film|silent movie]] era, the advent of the [[sound film|talkies]] and [[television program|television]], 

as well as starring roles on the [[theatre|stage]], and in [[radio programming|radio]]. Some of her more notable silent 

movies include a leading role in ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' ([[1922 in film|1922]]), one of the first movies made in color, 

[[Douglas Fairbanks]]' ''[[The Thief of Bagdad]]'' ([[1924 in film|1924]]), and ''[[Piccadilly (film)|Piccadilly]]'' ([[1929 

in film|1929]]). Wong was also featured in some notable talkies, including ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]'' ([[1931 in 

film|1931]]), ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' ([[1932 in film|1932]]), and ''[[Daughter of Shanghai]]'' 

([[1937 in film|1937]]), and starred in her own television series in the early 1950s.

Born near Los Angeles' Chinatown, Wong became infatuated with the movies and began acting in films at an early age. By 1924 

she had achieved international stardom. Frustrated by the stereotypical, supporting roles she was forced to play in 

Hollywood, Wong left for Europe in the late 1920s. While oversears she starred in several notable films and plays and 

solidified her image as an international fashion icon. She spent the first half of the 1930s traveling between the U.S. and 

Hollywood for film and stage appearances. In Hollywood she acted with [[Marlene Dietrich]] in [[Josef von Sternberg]]'s 

''Shanghai Express'', one of Wong's best-remembered film roles. 

In 1935 Wong received the bitterest disappointment of her career when MGM passed her over for the leading role in their film 

version of [[Pearl Buck]]'s ''[[The Good Earth]]'' in favor of a European woman in "[[yellowface]]". Wong spent the next year 

touring China, where visited her family's ancestral village and studied Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, Wong starred in 

several [[B movie]]s for [[Paramount Pictures]] notable for their positive portrayal of Chinese Americans. Her film career 

slowed down during the war years as Wong devoted her time and money to helping the Chinese cause against Japan. She returned 

to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances, including her own series. As Wong was planning to come back 

into film in ''[[Flower Drum Song (film)|Flower Drum Song]]'', she died in 1961 at the age of 56. 

For decades after her death, Wong was remembered principally for the stereotypical "Dragon Lady" and "Butterfly" roles that 

she reluctantly played in many of her films. During the 2000s, in the years surrounding the centennial of her birth, re-

evaluation of her life and career took place with three major literary works, and major film retrospectives. Her place in 

film history, as the first Asian American star, remains secure. 
==Biography==
===Early life===
Anna May Wong was born on Flower Street in [[Los Angeles, California]], in an integrated community one block north of 

[[Chinatown]], consisting of, besides Chinese, [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germans|German]], and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] 

residents.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 2, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Her birthname was '''Wong Liu Tsong''', a name which, translated into English 

means "Frosted Yellow Willows."&lt;ref name="frosted"&gt;Woo 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong was the daughter of Wong Sam Sing and his second wife, Lee Gon Toy.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of Anna May 

Wong's parents were second generation [[Chinese Americans]], and both sets of her grandparents were living in the U.S. by 

least 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Anna May's paternal grandfather, A Wong Wong, was a merchant who owned two stores in 

the gold-mining area of California, in Michigan Hills, [[Placer County, California|Placer County]]. He had come from Chang 

On, a village near [[Taishan]], [[Guangdong Province]], [[China]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents of Anna 

May's father died when he was a child, and he spent his youth traveling between the U.S. and the family's ancestral home. He 

married in China in 1889, and had a son born in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong returned to the U.S. in the late 

1890s, and, while continuing to support his family in China, married a second wife, Anna May's mother, Lee Gon Toy, in 

1901.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 1, 7–8, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple's first child, Anna May's older sister Lew Ying (Lulu), was born late 

in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; After Anna May's birth in 1905, came a younger brother Yah Wing (James), a younger 

sister, Lew Huang (Mary), and younger brothers Way Ying (Frank), Suey Ying (Roger), and Kim Ying (Richard).&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, 

pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna May Wong's father ran a [[laundromat]] called "Sam Kee Laundry."&lt;ref name="Finch p.231"&gt;Finch and Rosenkrantz 1979, p. 

231.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in her childhood, the family moved back into Chinatown, and then, in 1910, to a neighborhood on [[Figueroa 

Street]] where the family remained until 1934. The Wongs were the only Chinese on their block, with mostly [[Mexican]] and 

[[Eastern European]] families. There were now two hills between the new home and Chinatown; this helped influence Wong to 

[[assimilate]] further into [[American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong first attended public school with her 

older sister, but after suffering racism directed by other students, her parents moved them to the Presbyterian Chinese 

School, with classes taught in English. Wong also attended a [[Chinese school|Chinese language school]] on afternoons and 

Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of her childhood, filming for "[[flickers]]" began relocating from [[New York City]] to the Los Angeles area. 

Movies were being shot constantly in and around Wong's neighborhood and she soon began going to the [[Nickelodeon movie 

theater|Nickeoldeons]]. She became obsessed with the cinema and would skip school and use lunch money to attend theaters. At 

home she would act out her favorite scenes from films in front of a mirror.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Her favorite 

stars were [[Pearl White]] and [[Ruth Roland]]. Her father was not happy with her interest in films. He felt it interfered 

with her studies and when he found out she had skipped school for the nickelodeon, he would spank her with a [[bamboo]] 

stick.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Wong decided to pursue a career in film. At nine years of age, she walked 

up and begged filmmakers for parts, earning her the nickname "C.C.C." or "Curious Chinese Child."&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 

21.&lt;/ref&gt;

<turn_topictext>Approximate word count for Wikipedia article on the philosopher G.W.F. Hegel (selected purely at random): 6,571.

Approximate word count for Wikipedia article on actress Anna May Wong: 6,115.

This is pathetic, the sort of thing that will forever keep Wikipedia, if not a laughingstock, then severely lacking in credibility--unless, of course, the aim is to make Wikipedia the in-depth pop culture resource of choice. If so, then by all means, let's have more 6,000-plus word articles on minor Hollywood figures. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Pernoctus (talk • contribs) 02:47, 5 August 2010 (UTC)

Welcome to Wikipedia, the encyclopedia anyone can edit or bitch about. So what's keeping you from writing about Hegel? You want to tear this article down because others are in poor shape? Get off your ass or stop complaining. Dekkappai (talk) 03:42, 5 August 2010 (UTC)
The only Asian American to merit star billing in a feature film for many decades, the first Asian to star in a television series, however short-lived, doesn't need some effete Hegelian to attack her fifty years after her death, when we see that Asian-Americans are still hard-pressed to see anyone on screen who reflects their racial characteristics.

As an Asian-American, I am pretty mad to see this message. Ueutyi (talk) 03:02, 17 August 2016 (UTC)
Actually, I think the issue is that you are far too self-important to understand why Anna May Wong is much more important than you are. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 206.253.223.193 (talk) 20:37, 28 March 2017 (UTC)
