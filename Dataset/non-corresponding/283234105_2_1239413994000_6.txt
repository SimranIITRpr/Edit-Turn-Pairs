<edit_text>2000–2001
The 2000–2001 season witnessed many changes to USAD. The program's executive director of four years, James Alvino, resigned&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; after controversy broke regarding a religious article Alvino had written and had included in that year's Super Quiz Resource Guide. Alvino stated, &quot;I think that misunderstandings surrounding that article helped precipitate these actions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; USAD also altered their testing policies: 50% of test questions were to come from USAD published &quot;Resource Guides&quot; and 50% were to come from <strong><strike>other </strike></strong>unspecified sources. Before the 2000 season, students had to do all of their research independently; in 2000 they did not have to independently research anything.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Economics focused on business organizations and profiles in individual enterprise rather than macroeconomics and microeconomics as it had for the previous 19 years. A decrease in scores followed these changes; the national winner that year, El Camino Real High School, had a score of 5,923 points less than the score put up by James E. Taylor High School, the previous year's winner.&lt;ref name=2001_nats&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000–2001 season was also significant in that it was the first year that states were allowed to send both their large and small school champions to the national competition.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, this practice was short-lived and was discontinued after the 2002 season. Instead, a small school e-Nationals was introduced during the 2005–2006 school year.&lt;ref name=2006_ss_results&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The medium school e-Nationals was established two years later.</edit_text>

There is also concern that the competitions take up too much time. The National Association of Secondary School Principals, which publishes an annual list of contests and activities, does not endorse national contests that require team competition at a common site.'We do discourage national competitions of all kinds, said Scott D. Thomson, executive director of the association. They draw too much of the students' time and attention away from their regular schoolwork, But he added that the association did not object to the competitions themselves. We're opposed to the national dimension of it, Mr. Thomson said, not the academic competition dimension of it."

Anything else along these lines that people could think of? Criticisms of USAD is probably the only real thing missing from this article; a prose cleanup would be enough to get this article to FA. navyNuclearWarfare (greenTalk) 03:11, 4 April 2009 (UTC) About that LA Times article...I think that might be right here:http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/12/local/me-18619 I also found a few articles discussing that year's...issues. http://acadectalk.com/index.php?showtopic=3757 - Time, http://acadectalk.com/index.php?showtopic=3757 - Editorial by Larry Jones, posted on ADT by a decathlete from PA.
