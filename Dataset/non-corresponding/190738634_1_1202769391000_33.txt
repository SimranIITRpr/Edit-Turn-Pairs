<edit_text>During his lifetime, Rodin was compared to Michelangelo,&lt;ref name=&quot;alhadeff&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunisak&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunisak&quot;/&gt; Since the 1950s, Rodin's reputation has re-ascended;&lt;ref name=&quot;werner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; he is recognized as the most important sculptor of the modern era, and has been the subject of much scholarly work.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunisak&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of incompletion offered by some of his sculpture, such as The Walking Man, influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Taillandier, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The French order Légion d'honneur made him a Commander, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford. Though highly honoured for his artistic accomplishments, Rodin did not spawn a significant, lasting school of followers. His notable students included Antoine Bourdelle, Charles Despiau, the American Malvina Hoffman,<strong> and</strong> his mistress Camille Claudel, whose sculpture received praise in France. The French order Légion d'honneur made him a Commander, and Robert George Eberhard, to whom Rodin bequeathed his original sculpting tools. Later Eberhard gave them to George Holburn Snowden who in turn passed them on to his daughter M.L. Snowden, who still uses them today. &lt;ref name=&quot;snowden&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rodin restored an ancient role of sculpture—to capture the physical and intellectual force of the human subject&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot;/&gt;—and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the twentieth century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women—to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Rodin's tools</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>While we might like to include every piece of information on Rodin to make this a truly encyclopedic article, that is not possible. We have to carefully select items of true import. If you can find Rodin scholars who explain the artistic importance of the genealogy of Rodin's tools, we will include that information. However the citation you have included is to a commercial site, which is not reliable (see WP:RS, WP:V, and WP:ATT - these pages outline our policies on reliable sources). "Verifiability" is one of the cornerstone policies here at wikipedia. Thanks again! Awadewit | talk 22:14, 6 February 2008 (UTC) I have removed this information again. Please read these policies and source this information to reputable, scholarly publications. It looks like you should have no trouble doing that. Thanks! Awadewit | talk 22:47, 6 February 2008 (UTC)
Is is possible for you to provide me with WorldCat number for Into the Fire? I can't find it in a quick google search or at my research library. I thought I could use the information in the article to add more of a transition from the rest of the "Legacy" section to the tools bit. Awadewit | talk 23:25, 6 February 2008 (UTC)
I have not been able to verify that Into the Fire exists. It may, but it is incredibly difficult to track down. It would be very helpful if the editors who added it could point us to where we might find it. Thank you. Awadewit | talk 22:29, 11 February 2008 (UTC)
If the later history of his tools has any importance then it is to Snowden, not Rodin. font-family:Verdana;color:#0000eeYomanganitalk 23:36, 11 February 2008 (UTC)
Into the Fire is a supplementary publication to Art and Business News. I continue to dispute the exclusion of information about the whereabouts of Rodins' tools, or his creative successors. If I must, I will create a new page "Auguste Rodins' tools" or wherever it is most suitable, as I find it incredible that fellow scholars would suppress information in an encyclopedia. font-family:Verdana;color:#0000eeCttomassotalk 10:36, 12 February 2008 (UTC)
It does not strike one as a suppression of information, so much as an attempt to recognize suitability of content for a biography--the disposition of Rembrandt's brushes after his death, for instance, would be a footnote, at best. In other words, and this concept comes up time and again, not all information is of equal weight WP:ROC. JNW (talk) 20:55, 12 February 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
