<edit_text>In fall 1925, she was granted a visa to visit American relatives. As her train pulled away she called out to her family, &quot;By the time I return, I'll be famous!&quot; Leaving Russia on January 17, 1926, Rand <strong><strike>arrived in the United States on February 19, entering by ship through [[New York City]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=50–53}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=30}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She </strike></strong>was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan upon her arrival in New York Harbor that she cried what she later called &quot;tears of splendor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with relatives in Chicago, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free. She then set out for Hollywood, California.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Rand: "Christianity = Kindergarten of Communism"</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>I have removed a comment about Christianity being a "kindergarten of communism" according to Rand, as I do not feel that it merits inclusion. Superheroes Fighting (talk) 20:33, 20 March 2011 (UTC) Rather than simply notifying everyone that you removed it, it might be better if you included your rationale for removing it – and why it is not worthy of inclusion? &amp;#FF3333Red#FCC200thoreau -- (talk) 00:14, 21 March 2011 (UTC) Trivia, and no evidence that it's part of her philosophy. Superheroes Fighting (talk) 06:37, 21 March 2011 (UTC) Rand certainly had no love for Christianity, but this isn't Wikiquotes. It's enough to say she was opposed Christianity (and religion in general) due to it being A: "irrational" and B: altruistic. TallNapoleon (talk) 07:18, 21 March 2011 (UTC) Umm, that quote is an excellent summary of why, I think its fine. --#801818PapyrusSnowded #708090BaskervilleTALK 07:40, 21 March 2011 (UTC) Fair enough, I suppose. I'm just leery of including lots of quotes, since they tend to bloat articles. But given that this is six words I guess it's OK. TallNapoleon (talk) 07:56, 21 March 2011 (UTC)Can anyone explain why this comment by Rand in her journals about Christianity is part of her philosophy? Could it not rather have been simply an opinion of hers that wasn't part of her philosophy per se? It says nothing specific about why religion is "irrational" according to her, and I still think it should be removed. Superheroes Fighting (talk) 19:57, 24 March 2011 (UTC) I don't care one way or another about whether this particular quote is used, but for what it is worth here's a bit of context: The quote is cited from Jennifer Burns' biography. Anne Heller also quotes it in her bio. So from an encyclopedic standpoint it has the plus of having been identified by secondary sources as meaningful; it's not just something plucked by a WP editor from Rand's extensive library of quotable moments. But the sources don't necessarily agree on the significance of the quote. Burns discusses it in the context of Rand's ethical views, which corresponds with the larger topic Rand was writing about in her journals when she wrote that line. We are using it to illustrate her view of religion, which is the context in which Heller mentions it. Food for thought. --RL0919 (talk) 20:21, 24 March 2011 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
