<edit_text>Criteria
The Canadian Victoria Cross, as with the British VC, is awarded for &quot;most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.&quot; The Canadian government has defined the term enemy as a force hostile towards the Canadian government, which includes the following: armed mutineers, armed rebels, armed rioters, and armed pirates. However, Canada does not officially have to declare war to give acknowledgement of the existence of a hostile force that fits the above description. This means that a Canadian serving as part of a peacekeeping operation is eligible to be awarded the VC if the servicemember fulfils the above criteria. The time period for the service to be eligible for the Victoria Cross is on or after January 1, 1993. The Victoria Cross, along with the other military valour decorations, can be awarded posthumously. <strong>
In the case of a ''gallant and daring act'' being performed by a squadron, ship's company or a detached body of men (such as marines) in which all men are deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross then a ballot is drawn. The officers select one officer, the NCOs select one individual and the private soldiers or seamen select two individuals. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;'''Original Warrant, Clause 13:''' ''{{lang|ang|Thirteenthly. It is ordained that in the event of a gallant and daring act having been performed by a squadron, ship's company, or detached body of seamen and marines not under fifty in number, or by a brigade, regiment, troop or company in which the admiral, general, or other officer commanding such forces may deem that all are equally brave and distinguished, and that no special selection can be made by them, then is such case the admiral, general, or other officer commanding, may direct that for any such body of seamen or marines, or for every troop or company of soldiers, one officer shall be selected by the officers engaged for the Decoration, and in like manner one petty officer or non-commissioned officer shall be selected by the petty officers and non-commissioned officers engaged, and two seamen or private soldiers or marines shall be selected by the seamen, or private soldiers, or marines engaged, respectively for the Decoration, and the names of those selected shall be transmitted by the senior officers in command of the Naval force, brigade, regiment, troop, or company, to the admiral or general officer commanding, who shall in due manner confer the Decoration as if the acts were done under his own eye.}}''&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; 
</strong> Unlike the British VC, the Canadian Victoria Cross can be revoked.&lt;ref name=CFdescpage/&gt;</edit_text>
