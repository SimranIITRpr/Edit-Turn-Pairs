<edit_text>During his lifetime, Rodin was compared to Michelangelo,&lt;ref name=&quot;alhadeff&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunisak&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunisak&quot;/&gt; Since the 1950s, Rodin's reputation has re-ascended;&lt;ref name=&quot;werner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; he is recognized as the most important sculptor of the modern era, and has been the subject of much scholarly work.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunisak&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of incompletion offered by some of his sculpture, such as The Walking Man, influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Taillandier, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The French order Légion d'honneur made him a Commander, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford. Though highly honoured for his artistic accomplishments, Rodin did not spawn a significant, lasting school of followers. His notable students included Antoine Bourdelle, Charles Despiau, the American Malvina Hoffman, and his mistress Camille Claudel, whose sculpture received praise in France<strong>. The French order ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' made him a Commander</strong>, and Robert George Eberhard, to whom Rodin bequeathed his original sculpting tools. Later Eberhard gave them to George Holburn Snowden who in turn passed them on to his daughter M.L. Snowden, who still uses them today. &lt;ref name=&quot;snowden&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rodin restored an ancient role of sculpture—to capture the physical and intellectual force of the human subject&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot;/&gt;—and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the twentieth century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women—to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>The dry list that someone deleted is http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Auguste_Rodin&amp;oldid=189606896. It would seem to be of use to the Wikipedia reader. --Wetman (talk) 16:38, 10 February 2008 (UTC) The list was commented out (hidden) before Someone's (my) edit. I originally commented it out on the basis that lists don't seem to be encouraged on more well-developed articles, and I wasn't sure if its completeness warranted its presence in any case. I'll paste it here, and someone can make a new article to develop it, if they like. –#112299Outriggr&amp;§ 05:55, 11 February 2008 (UTC) "Locations of works" http://www.mkhalilmuseum.gov.eg/, Giza, Egypt
