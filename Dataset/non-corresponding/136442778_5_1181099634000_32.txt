<edit_text>Neutralization
Antibodies that recognize viruses can block these by binding them directly.&lt;ref name=Pier/&gt; In doing so, the virus is unable to dock to its preferred receptor for infecting a host cell. Some antibodies, like IgA, also directly bind to microbes in mucus to prevent the colonization of mucosal tissues<strong><strike>.  Antibodies, like</strike></strong><strong>, and</strong> those in antivenoms, neutralize toxins by binding to them.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Certain viruses may be able to evade the immune system if antibody neutralization is inadequate. For example, when viruses such as HIV, are not completely covered by neutralizing antibody, the presence of the antibodies can enhance viral infectivity instead of inhibiting it; HIV prefers to infect the cells that bind to antibodies.&lt;ref name=Weiss1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Antibodies cannot attack pathogens within cells, and certain viruses (such as HIV, HSV and HBV) &quot;hide&quot; inside cells for long periods of time to avoid them.&lt;ref name=Pier/&gt; This is the reason for the chronic nature of many minor skin diseases such as cold sores; any given outbreak is quickly suppressed by the immune system, but the infection is never truly eradicated because some cells retain viruses that will reactivate later, causing a resurgence of symptoms so the infection is never truly eradicated.&lt;ref name=Pier/&gt; Image:Fc receptor schematic big.png</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>I've noticed that a lot of reviewers want to see history sections in articles when they are proposed for the higher levels (!) so I put together a little mish-mash of history that I could find out there. I can't seem to make it flow though...any good copy-editors want to have a go?? Ciar 05:13, 6 June 2007 (UTC) Ciar 21:27, 20 May 2007 (UTC) Done. TimVickers 15:57, 6 June 2007 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
