<edit_text>He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to the expansion of slavery and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population.&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo, pp. 194â€“195.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable principles <strong><strike>for the future shaping of</strike></strong><strong>which shaped</strong> the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Anyone know what page number it is? - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 04:06, 29 October 2010 (UTC) The sentence covers all of 1861-65 as does the book. see the TOC on amazon.com Rjensen (talk) 06:27, 29 October 2010 (UTC)Sounds good. - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 17:51, 29 October 2010 (UTC) Do you know about the Boritt, Gabor S. (1978). Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream. reference? Is it the whole book? - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 21:53, 29 October 2010 (UTC) I just looked at the Boritt book--the chapters are chronological and each one deals with the same themes (like banks and tariffs and RR) at different points in Lincoln's life, so the reference should be to the whole book, not to specific pages.Rjensen (talk) 00:37, 30 October 2010 (UTC) Thanks for the quick replies. Keep an eye out, because I may have another similar question. - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 00:45, 30 October 2010 (UTC) I think this is another one where the whole book is the cite. Not sure. I found pages for the specific dates, times, and number of words. See dif.http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abraham_Lincoln&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=394079692&amp;oldid=394078826 - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 00:52, 1 November 2010 (UTC) I've replaced the Tagg cite- it now references a magazine piece he did covering the point being made in the article and hopefully now we don't have a page problem (I didn't include an external link). I didn't know you were on this, since it wasn't on the GA page. Not too sure about how good a reference Tagg is, but that's another issue.Carmarg4 (talk) 14:17, 9 November 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
