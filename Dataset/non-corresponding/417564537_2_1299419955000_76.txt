<edit_text>Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech
The 1858 campaign featured the seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, generally considered the most famous political debates in American history.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1993), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln had found clarity and renewed political purpose after the Kansas-Nebraska Act, <strong><strike>authored by Douglas, became law and</strike></strong><strong>that</strong> allowed slavery to extend across the 36° 31' parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer (2008), Giants, pp. 187-189&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln warned that &quot;The Slave Power&quot; was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal, while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 214–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln stated that Douglas was part of an evil conspiracy to extend slavery to every state in the Union, even those states who had outlawed the institution. Douglas had stated that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision. &lt;ref&gt;Stauffer (2008), Giants, pp. 194-197&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>
