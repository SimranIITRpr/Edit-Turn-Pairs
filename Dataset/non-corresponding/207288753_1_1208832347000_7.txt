<edit_text>Hinduism
<strong><strike>Hindu scriptures refer to the Vedic period (before ca. 500 BC) which Hindus see as the age of an exemplary civilization and as the source of all moral norms.

</strike></strong>
Non-human life
Hindus do not substantially differentiate the soul within a human body within that of an animal.&lt;ref&gt;http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/5/18/en1 &quot;The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Hence ahimsa as a binding code of conduct implies a ban on hunting, butchery, meat eating, and the use of animal products provided by violent means. The question of moral duties towards animals and of negative Karma incurred from violence against them is discussed in detail in some Hindu scriptures and religious lawbooks.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Hello. I will be doing the review for this article. There are a few things that really jump out at me when looking at the article, so here are a few things to fix: The lead needs to be expanded per WP:LEAD. For an article this size, it should be about 2 or 3 full paragraphs, and it should adequately summarize all the main points made in the article.
--Redtigerxyz (talk) 04:58, 21 April 2008 (UTC) Refs should go after punctuation, not in the middle of sentences.
Refs in middle of sentences after , or ; are excepted as shown in the example in Wikipedia:REF#Footnotes.--Redtigerxyz (talk) 04:12, 21 April 2008 (UTC)I am aware of that rule. I was referring, specifically, to #17, 37, 39-42, 47, and 52. They are either in the midst of a sentence or before the , or ;. TealNikkiSalmon311 14:14, 21 April 2008 (UTC) Ref 39-42 are kept in mid of sentences because they are refs for each Indian spiritual leader, if moved to the end of the sentence, it would be confusing which ref refers for which person.--Redtigerxyz (talk) 04:43, 22 April 2008 (UTC)There are quite a few paragraphs that are one or two sentences long. Either merge them into other paragraphs, expand them, or delete them.
Can the reviewer please list them. Thanks.--Redtigerxyz (talk) 04:13, 21 April 2008 (UTC)No problem: the last paragraph of the lead, the only sentence under Hinduism (before Non-human life), first and third paragraphs under Modern times, and the last paragraph under Jainism. Also, the Buddhism section would be better in paragraph form, as opposed to a list. It is okay to have one or two short paragraphs (sometimes that can't be avoided), but it is best to fix as many as possible. TealNikkiSalmon311 14:14, 21 April 2008 (UTC) I think "Modern times" is just fine it is at the moment, divided 3 paras: 1. leaders, background 2. Gandhi 3.'reverence for life' philosophy.--Redtigerxyz (talk) 04:45, 22 April 2008 (UTC)I don't know much about the religion related WikiProjects, but is there an infobox of some sort that can be put in the article? If not, that is okay.
don't any, which will emcompass all religions involved. Suggestions are welcome.--Redtigerxyz (talk) 04:05, 21 April 2008 (UTC)I don't know any either. It is fine without one. TealNikkiSalmon311 14:14, 21 April 2008 (UTC)The See Also section should be above the References section.
--Redtigerxyz (talk) 04:05, 21 April 2008 (UTC) That's all for now. You have a week to make changes or I will fail the article. If you are still actively editing the article when the week is up, I have no problem allowing more time. Thanks a lot. TealNikkiSalmon311 21:10, 18 April 2008 (UTC) Okay. Good work. I've done a quick copy edit, and now everything seems to be in order. I'll pass the article. TealNikkiSalmon311 23:26, 22 April 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
