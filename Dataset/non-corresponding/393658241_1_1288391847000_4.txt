<edit_comment>remove &amp;quot;nationalism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy&amp;quot; from first para since it's also in the fourth.  It makes the sentence more punchy.</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809&amp;nbsp;â€“ April 15, 1865) served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. He successfully led the country through its greatest internal crisis, the American Civil War, preserving the Union,<strong><strike> ending [[slavery]],</strike></strong> and rededicating the nation to nationalism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. Reared in a poor family on the western frontier, he was mostly self-educated. He became a country lawyer, an Illinois state legislator, and a one-term member of the United States House of Representatives, but failed in two attempts at a seat in the United States Senate. He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband, and father of four children.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Anyone know what page number it is? - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 04:06, 29 October 2010 (UTC) The sentence covers all of 1861-65 as does the book. see the TOC on amazon.com Rjensen (talk) 06:27, 29 October 2010 (UTC)Sounds good. - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 17:51, 29 October 2010 (UTC) Do you know about the Boritt, Gabor S. (1978). Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream. reference? Is it the whole book? - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 21:53, 29 October 2010 (UTC) I just looked at the Boritt book--the chapters are chronological and each one deals with the same themes (like banks and tariffs and RR) at different points in Lincoln's life, so the reference should be to the whole book, not to specific pages.Rjensen (talk) 00:37, 30 October 2010 (UTC) Thanks for the quick replies. Keep an eye out, because I may have another similar question. - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 00:45, 30 October 2010 (UTC) I think this is another one where the whole book is the cite. Not sure. I found pages for the specific dates, times, and number of words. See dif.http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abraham_Lincoln&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=394079692&amp;oldid=394078826 - Peregrine Fisher (talk) 00:52, 1 November 2010 (UTC) I've replaced the Tagg cite- it now references a magazine piece he did covering the point being made in the article and hopefully now we don't have a page problem (I didn't include an external link). I didn't know you were on this, since it wasn't on the GA page. Not too sure about how good a reference Tagg is, but that's another issue.Carmarg4 (talk) 14:17, 9 November 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
