<edit_text>The United Methodist Church upholds the sanctity of unborn human life and is reluctant to affirm abortion as an acceptable practice, except when the life and well-being of the mother <strong><strike>is threatened</strike></strong><strong>and the unborn child. The UMC recognizes tragic conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion, and in such cases supports the legal option of abortion under proper medical procedures</strong>. Further, the church strongly condemns the use of late-term or partial birth abortion, except if the life of the mother is in jeopardy.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC - Abortion&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is committed to &quot;assist the ministry of crisis pregnancy centers and pregnancy resource centers that compassionately help women find feasible alternatives to abortion;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NRL-UMC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; however, the Church recognizes the legal right of the mother to choose after proper consideration of all options with medical, pastoral and other counsel.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC - Abortion&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Why not make your mass edit in sections rather than as a mass edit? You don't own this page, and people made good faith, CITED, edits to this page. You reverted the edits on a whim without discussion. If you made any sort of arguments your edits might be palatable, but in the present form you are introducing NPOV which is contrary to the source documents used to make the edits you reversed. Please suggest your changes here before cutting apart good faith edits by others. Revmqo (talk) 11:23, 27 March 2010 (UTC) Mass editing? I actually wrote a good deal of this article. The "inclusivity" section is not needed at all. How is it even a social issue? The underlying reason for even placing that section within the article is to point towards homosexuality, which is already covered in its own section. The "Saints" section previously had some more clarity, which is why I restored some deleted content. Personally, I do not even think the section really belongs in this article because the practice of the "veneration of the Saints" is virtually nonexistent in the United Methodist Church. Having this section in the article is similar to creating sections such as "Purgatory in United Methodism" or "Apostolic Succession in United Methodism," which, really, do not play a major role in the life of United Methodism. Issues such as imparted righteousness or Christian perfection might be better to discuss in this article. As far as the changing of the polity in the information box, did you not see the reference (with a quote that was provided therein)? I would appreciate your comments so I can re-implement the changes I made to the article.
