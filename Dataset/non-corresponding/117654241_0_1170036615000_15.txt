<turn_topictext>Krimuk. Please understand that what belongs in the body has to be summarised in the lead this is notable and in the news, please read MOS:LEAD again and express your opinion on the talk page without edit warring.--DBigXrayᗙ 11:56, 9 January 2020 (UTC)

The fact that some religious nincompoops wrongly wrote articles without seeing a film is in no way notable enough for the lead. Cyphoidbomb and Fylindfotberserk, what do you think? Krimuk2.0 (talk) 12:08, 9 January 2020 (UTC)
Krimuk2.0, what you are calling religious nincompoops are actually devious right wing agents (and that includes several BJP leaders and MPs) who are using these Hindu-Muslim rumours about religion in the film as a tool to punish Deepika for siding with the JNU. In any case, almost all the mainstream newspapers are covering it e.g. [1] [2] and it has to be covered in the article in some way. Removing it, amounts to whitewashing. What has to be in the article has to be in the lead in a summarized way. Please feel free to propose a different version of the content on the talk page if you dont agree, but please do ot remove this. DBigXrayᗙ 12:21, 9 January 2020 (UTC)
According to WP:FILMLEAD, the succeeding paragraphs should cover significant impact the film has made in society. The current situation IRL is obviously notable, but can this be called as an "impact on the society"? As an analogy, the Padmaavat article does mention the "violent protest" it received at the time of its release. - Fylindfotberserk (talk) 12:57, 9 January 2020 (UTC)
Indeed, and as of now this is the major controversy, blown out of proportions by the BJP workers/supporters.--DBigXrayᗙ 13:01, 9 January 2020 (UTC)
The Padmaavat controversy was at a whole another level. Years into the future, Padmaavat is going to be remembered for the resulting furore, but will Chhapaak be remembered for a fake rumour as trivial as this? Although the future can be blurry, my intuitive crystal ball says its very unlikely. WP:NOTNEWS is something to keep in mind. DeluxeVegan (talk) 13:55, 9 January 2020 (UTC)
DeluxeVegan, your crystal ball has rusted and needs to be thrown in the dustbin for being so ineffective here. As for Padmavat fame, here is Karni Sena rising. What matters is that there are national newspapers covering this incident and rightly so</turn_topictext>
