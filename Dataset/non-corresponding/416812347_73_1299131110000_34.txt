<edit_text>The term &quot;black hole&quot; was first publicly used by John Wheeler during a lecture in 1967. Although he is usually credited with coining the phrase, he always insisted that it was suggested to him by somebody else. The first recorded use of the term is in a 1964 letter by Anne Ewing to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.&lt;ref&gt;<strong><strike>{{cite web</strike></strong><strong>

<turn_topictext>respected sir/Madam, I have some concepts of black hole which i want to share with every one so please allow me to edit the page to post my view point thak you Raza536 (talk) 06:45, 3 March 2011 (UTC) Raza536 (talk) 06:45, 3 March 2011 (UTC) You would need to suggest specific edits. Jehochman Talk 11:27, 3 March 2011 (UTC) Per WP:NOR, this is also probably not the best place to try to present your own ideas about black holes. The Wikipedia article is supposed to focus on information that's already been published in sources that meet the guidelines given in WP:RS (in this case, academic literature). --Christopher Thomas (talk) 19:05, 3 March 2011 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
