<turn_topicname>"Radio presenter"?</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Apart from a mention of a single show in 2014 and a series in 2016, I can't find much in the article that would justify the prominence of the word "radio" in the opening sentence of the article and the infobox. She was known as a television presenter. Should the words "Radio and..." be removed - or, at least, be made far less prominent in the article? Ghmyrtle (talk) 09:42, 16 February 2020 (UTC)

Yes, I agree. Should be less prominent or removed. Martinevans123 (talk) 10:10, 16 February 2020 (UTC)
Perhaps as an interim measure, I've changed the order to "television and radio presenter".</turn_topictext>
