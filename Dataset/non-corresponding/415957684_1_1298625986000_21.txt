<edit_text>Ahimsa (Sanskrit: Devanagari; ; IAST , PƒÅli: ) is a term meaning to do no harm (literally: the avoidance of violence - himsa).<strong> The word is derived from the Sanskrit root ''hims'' - to strike; ''himsa'' is injury or harm, ''a-himsa'' is the opposite of this, i.e.  ''non harming'' or ''[[nonviolence]]''.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Shukavak N. Dasa&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/nonharming_ahimsa.html A Hindu Primer], by [http://www.sanskrit.org/www/shukavak.htm Shukavak N. Dasa]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;</strong> It is an important tenet of the Indian religions (Hinduism, Buddhism and especially Jainism). Ahimsa means kindness and non-violence towards all living things including animals; it respects living beings as a unity, the belief that all living things are connected. Indian leader Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi strongly believed in this principle.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsblaze.com/story/20071014111738kuma.nb/topstory.html&lt;/ref&gt; Avoidance of verbal and physical violence is also a part of this principle, although ahimsa recognizes self-defense when necessary, as a sign of a strong spirit. It is closely connected with the notion that all kinds of violence entail negative karmic consequences.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Ambedkars' Voice</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>The content is noteworthy as the other statements. I agree with you that Babasaheb Ambedkar is an important voice, but what I could not understant is that why this matter do not belongs here. If you want a discussion on it, then why deleting it?.........Ranjithsutari (talk) 18:32, 23 May 2010 (UTC) Hi Ranjith, the idea is that this article is written using academic sources. Ambedkar is more of a religious figure. Does that make sense? Mitsube (talk) 00:30, 24 May 2010 (UTC)Hi, Mitsube, I'm sorry to say that your idea is Absolutely nonsense!!! OR I could not understand your sense of Academic sources on this article. What if Ambedkar is more or real of religious/political/philosophical/Historical/Revolutionary figure, this content is noteworthy because there is a touch of optimism in every word................Ranjithsutari (talk) 19:58, 24 May 2010 (UTC) Hi ! Ranjithsutari, Ambedkar was no where near Ahinsa. He was solely focused of only Harjans. Ahinsa that much he talk about is atleast talk by every good leader in India.--Rajan11222533 (talk) 10:26, 25 February 2011 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
