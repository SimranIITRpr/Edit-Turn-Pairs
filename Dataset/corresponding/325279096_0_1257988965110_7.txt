<turn_topictext>Eilish became the first artist to win the major four categories of Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist in the same year since Norah Jones in 2003.

Not Christopher Cross in 1981.

@TheCommish9000: From what I found, Norah Jones technically didn't win Song of the Year as she didn't write any of "Don't Know Why". The award went to the sole lyricist Jesse Harris. Source. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Don't forget to share a Thanks ♥) 01:45, 29 January 2020 (UTC)
@Nice4What: Thanks for clearing that up. </turn_topictext>
