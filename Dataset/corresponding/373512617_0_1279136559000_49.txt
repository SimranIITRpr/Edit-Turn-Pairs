<edit_comment>/* Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties */ Added Sec and Pyl to the table...</edit_comment>
<edit_text><strong>Additionally, there are two additional amino acids which are incorporated by overriding stop codons:

{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;
! Ambiguous Amino Acids
! 3-Letter
! 1-Letter
|- align=&amp;quot;center&amp;quot;
| Selenocysteine
| Sec
| U
|- align=&amp;quot;center&amp;quot;
| Pyrrolysine
| Pyl
| O
|}

</strong>In addition to the specific amino acid codes, placeholders are used in cases where chemical or crystallographic analysis of a peptide or protein can not conclusively determine the identity of a residue.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>I have added expanded genetic code by copy paste from genetic code, but I have not mentioned the letter codes used for the amino acids as they are non-iupac and author specific and re-use the other non-20 ), which gets confusing (non ascii capital letters (Þ, Ð, Ü etc) cannot be used for various encoding reasons). --Squidonius (talk) 21:42, 14 July 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
