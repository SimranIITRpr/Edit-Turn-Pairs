<edit_text>The 767-400ER's closest competitor from Airbus is the A330-200.&lt;ref name=Flug767-400&gt;[http://<strong>web.archive.org/web/20080513172529/http://</strong>www.flug-revue.rotor.com/Frtypen/FR767400.htm &quot;Boeing 767-400ER&quot;] (archived).

<turn_topicname>A340 competition?</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>If you look on the page for the A340, it says that the A342 directly competes with the B764ER. However, in the section of this article with information about the B764ER, it says the competition is directly with the A332. Perhaps this was a mistake and the direct competitor with the B764ER is the A342? I actually don't see any reason why they shouldn't be. The B764ER and the A342, despite have different fuel capacities, are similar in size and pax capacity. Thoughts? --98.250.92.159 (talk) 19:42, 18 December 2010 (UTC) The A330 comparison here is per the Flug Revue http://web.archive.org/web/20080513172529/http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/Frtypen/FR767400.htm. The comparison in the A340 article is currently unreferenced there. If reliable reference can be found for the 767-400 being comparable to the A340 and others, then we can add it. -fnlayson (talk) 02:14, 19 December 2010 (UTC) Airliners.net also says the B764ER directly competes with the A332. So, the A340 page is probably incorrect in saying that the A342 directly competes with the B764ER. But I guess it would be correct to say the A342 competes somewhat or "indirectly" with the B764ER. Like I said, they are similar in passenger capacity (though I think I was incorrect in saying that they are similar in size) despite the A342 having greater fuel than the B764ER. In addition, fuel efficiency for the two planes can be compared. --98.250.92.159 (talk) 19:45, 23 December 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
