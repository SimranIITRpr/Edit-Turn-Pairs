<edit_comment>capitalize Aspirin</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Polymorphism, or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for <strong><strike>a</strike></strong><strong>A</strong>spirin was known, although there had been indications that aspirin might have a second crystalline form since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and fine structural details were given by Bond et al.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A new crystal type was found after attempted co-crystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100 K and reverts back to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Renaming "aspirin" to "Aspirin"</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>has been renaming "aspirin" to "Aspirin" both here and on related articles and article titles. Is he going to edit all the 2,000 other pages on Wikipedia that mention the word? The name is not a trademark in the US, which is the law governing Wikipedia. I recommend this action be undone. Colin°Talk 19:11, 7 November 2008 (UTC) Undone here and at Mechanism_of_action_of_aspirin. In addition to the uncivil ENGVAR violation, he has altered the capitalization in several titles of cited articles, which is, strictly taken, a verifiability problem. Most regrettable. Septentrionalis PMAnderson 20:00, 7 November 2008 (UTC)I've moved History of aspirin back as well. Fvasconcellos&amp;(t·c) 20:47, 7 November 2008 (UTC)
And he's just http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_aspirin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=251096992 my edit to remove the capital letter and his POV from the lead of the history of aspirin article. Anyone like to have another go? I have a personal one revert rule. Andrewa (talk) 09:39, 13 November 2008 (UTC) As you can see from the above straw poll, there is no consensus on the trademark issue so can we just mention in the appropriate portions of the Aspirin and History of aspirin articles as well as their introductions that Aspirin is a trademark in most of the world? Steelbeard1 (talk) 12:50, 13 November 2008 (UTC)Steelbeard1, there was no consensus for the proposed move, which is required before change can occur. Do not interpret the lack of unanimity as an indication that changing the capitalisation of the word is allowed. Per WP:ENGVAR, please leave the capitalisation/spelling in a consistent state and avoid changes towards your preferred style. Colin°Talk 13:28, 13 November 2008 (UTC)Agree that the trademark status needs to be mentioned in appropriate places. But stating in the first line of the article that it is a trademark, with no qualification that this is untrue in much of the English-speaking world, was quite frankly misinformation. Better to say nothing. To revert the removal of this misinformation as you did was not good. Best of all to make it clear of course. The current article is the best yet, always room for improvement but please, no more misinformation. Andrewa (talk) 18:32, 13 November 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
