<edit_comment>Expanding, on second thought.</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Despite rapid scientific progress, much about how brains work remains a mystery. The operations of individual neurons and synapses are now understood in considerable detail, but the way they cooperate in ensembles of thousands or millions has been very difficult to decipher.<strong> Methods of observation such as [[EEG]] recording and [[neuroimaging|functional brain imaging]] tell us that brain operations are highly organized, while [[single unit recording]] can resolve the activity of single neurons, but how individual cells give rise to complex operations is unknown.</strong>&lt;ref&gt;Sejnowski, 23 Problems in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Grossly misleading / incomplete paragraph in intro</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>"Methods of observation such as EEG recording and functional brain imaging tell us that brain operations are highly organized, but these methods do not have the resolution to reveal the activity of individual neurons.[7]" True enough, but failing to mention single unit recording is grossly misleading. font-size: smaller;autosignedâ€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 64.253.210.29 (talk) 22:51, 3 March 2010 (UTC) I agree with you. I've removed the sentence as a temporary fix, but it really needs more work. --Tryptofish (talk) 23:48, 3 March 2010 (UTC)On second thought, I expanded the sentence to include single units, but it could probably still use some more work. --Tryptofish (talk) 23:55, 3 March 2010 (UTC) Well, the reason I wrote it that way is that single unit recording doesn't really tell us how brain operations are organized, because it only shows us one unit at a time. We don't really have good techniques for showing the relationships between individual neurons. (I'm aware of multi-single-unit recording, in fact most of my own work has used it, but it has major limitations.) Anyway, I accept that the passage needed work, just wanted to explain the thinking. This is a quick response; I'll take another look at the sentence. Regards, Looie496 (talk) 00:23, 4 March 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
