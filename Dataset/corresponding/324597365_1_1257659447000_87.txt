<turn_topictext>Someone had deleted the controversies section about Cokie Roberts earlier and they used the Wikipedia:DUST rule to justify it, I did not think about it before, but he is right, those kind of news are better left for the future, especially the recent comments about Obama, since it hasn't even been a year. Please consider reviewing DUST to avoid adding trivial information which may very well be ephemeral and not important from an encyclopedia point of view. mijotoba (talk) 23:38, 10 November 2008 (UTC)

And someone stuck it back in again. It's minor trivia in her career; it might have been important enough for the press to cover in the heat of her campaign, but otherwise, feh, who cares that a reporter says something clueless? --jpgordon∇∆∇∆ 05:56, 19 November 2008 (UTC)
Agree, they are all DUST. What a trivial waste. Will delete according to WP:DUST. It's just chatter. The paragraph supposedly sourced from John Sherman's book, Latin America in Crisis, sounds like OR. Also, I tried to find the references in Sherman's book today while working on the page for Dianna Ortiz and could not do it - a Google search did not reveal Roberts, her brother Boggs, Jr., nor his lobbying firm in this book. Unless someone has a quote from Nightline, and a quote and page cite from Sherman making this connection, this is not adequately sourced to use.Parkwells (talk) 19:32, 14 June 2013 (UTC)
The information is more than 15 years old, so I'm not sure it qualifies as WP:DUST. I did a quick Google search for "diane ortiz cokie roberts" and found plenty of information. I don't think that providing a quote automatically gives adequate source to something, but I'll find one. Below is the actual paragraph. Mvblair (talk) 14:34, 28 October 2013 (UTC)
While working in Guatemala, Sister Dianna Ortiz, a Catholic nun from New Mexico, was raped and tortured by members of a death squad until a US supervisor recognized that she was from the US.[12] Although there was no doubt of Ortiz's torture and ample evidence to corroborate her claims of an American supervisor, Roberts insisted that Ortiz was lying in a 1996 interview with Ortiz on the TV show "Nightline." Roberts' brother, Tom Boggs, working for the advertising firm of "Patton, Boggs, & Blow," was paid by the Guatemalan military to promote a more positive image of the death squads and the military dictatorship in Guatemala.[13] This incident caused a tremendous amount of scrutiny into other potential nepotistic relationships within the media.
I updated the page, per these suggestions and included references to Nightlin. It should be a little cleaner now. Not having a "controversies" section, I included it in the discussion about her general career. Mvblair (talk) 01:03, 9 December 2013 (UTC)

It appears that someone just renamed the section and put it under "Criticism" That entire section reads more like someone's opinion than an actual non-biased article. Sources seem to all be opinion pieces. Section needs to be reworked, or deleted entirely. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.183.47.148 (talk) 18:33, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
