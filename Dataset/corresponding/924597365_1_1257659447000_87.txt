<edit_text>'Anna May Wong''' ([[January 3]], [[1905]] &amp;ndash; [[February 2]], [[1961]]) was an [[United States|American]] 

[[actor|actress]], the first [[Chinese American]] [[movie star]], and the first female Asian American star. Her screen career 

spanned the [[silent film|silent movie]] era, the advent of the [[sound film|talkies]] and [[television program|television]], 

as well as starring roles on the [[theatre|stage]], and in [[radio programming|radio]]. Some of her more notable silent 

movies include a leading role in ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' ([[1922 in film|1922]]), one of the first movies made in color, 

[[Douglas Fairbanks]]' ''[[The Thief of Bagdad]]'' ([[1924 in film|1924]]), and ''[[Piccadilly (film)|Piccadilly]]'' ([[1929 

in film|1929]]). Wong was also featured in some notable talkies, including ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]'' ([[1931 in 

film|1931]]), ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' ([[1932 in film|1932]]), and ''[[Daughter of Shanghai]]'' 

([[1937 in film|1937]]), and starred in her own television series in the early 1950s.

Born near Los Angeles' Chinatown, Wong became infatuated with the movies and began acting in films at an early age. By 1924 

she had achieved international stardom. Frustrated by the stereotypical, supporting roles she was forced to play in 

Hollywood, Wong left for Europe in the late 1920s. While oversears she starred in several notable films and plays and 

solidified her image as an international fashion icon. She spent the first half of the 1930s traveling between the U.S. and 

Hollywood for film and stage appearances. In Hollywood she acted with [[Marlene Dietrich]] in [[Josef von Sternberg]]'s 

''Shanghai Express'', one of Wong's best-remembered film roles. 

In 1935 Wong received the bitterest disappointment of her career when MGM passed her over for the leading role in their film 

version of [[Pearl Buck]]'s ''[[The Good Earth]]'' in favor of a European woman in "[[yellowface]]". Wong spent the next year 

touring China, where visited her family's ancestral village and studied Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, Wong starred in 

several [[B movie]]s for [[Paramount Pictures]] notable for their positive portrayal of Chinese Americans. Her film career 

slowed down during the war years as Wong devoted her time and money to helping the Chinese cause against Japan. She returned 

to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances, including her own series. As Wong was planning to come back 

into film in ''[[Flower Drum Song (film)|Flower Drum Song]]'', she died in 1961 at the age of 56. 

For decades after her death, Wong was remembered principally for the stereotypical "Dragon Lady" and "Butterfly" roles that 

she reluctantly played in many of her films. During the 2000s, in the years surrounding the centennial of her birth, re-

evaluation of her life and career took place with three major literary works, and major film retrospectives. Her place in 

film history, as the first Asian American star, remains secure. 
==Biography==
===Early life===
Anna May Wong was born on Flower Street in [[Los Angeles, California]], in an integrated community one block north of 

[[Chinatown]], consisting of, besides Chinese, [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germans|German]], and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] 

residents.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 2, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Her birthname was '''Wong Liu Tsong''', a name which, translated into English 

means "Frosted Yellow Willows."&lt;ref name="frosted"&gt;Woo 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong was the daughter of Wong Sam Sing and his second wife, Lee Gon Toy.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of Anna May 

Wong's parents were second generation [[Chinese Americans]], and both sets of her grandparents were living in the U.S. by 

least 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Anna May's paternal grandfather, A Wong Wong, was a merchant who owned two stores in 

the gold-mining area of California, in Michigan Hills, [[Placer County, California|Placer County]]. He had come from Chang 

On, a village near [[Taishan]], [[Guangdong Province]], [[China]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents of Anna 

May's father died when he was a child, and he spent his youth traveling between the U.S. and the family's ancestral home. He 

married in China in 1889, and had a son born in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong returned to the U.S. in the late 

1890s, and, while continuing to support his family in China, married a second wife, Anna May's mother, Lee Gon Toy, in 

1901.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 1, 7–8, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple's first child, Anna May's older sister Lew Ying (Lulu), was born late 

in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; After Anna May's birth in 1905, came a younger brother Yah Wing (James), a younger 

sister, Lew Huang (Mary), and younger brothers Way Ying (Frank), Suey Ying (Roger), and Kim Ying (Richard).&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, 

pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna May Wong's father ran a [[laundromat]] called "Sam Kee Laundry."&lt;ref name="Finch p.231"&gt;Finch and Rosenkrantz 1979, p. 

231.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in her childhood, the family moved back into Chinatown, and then, in 1910, to a neighborhood on [[Figueroa 

Street]] where the family remained until 1934. The Wongs were the only Chinese on their block, with mostly [[Mexican]] and 

[[Eastern European]] families. There were now two hills between the new home and Chinatown; this helped influence Wong to 

[[assimilate]] further into [[American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong first attended public school with her 

older sister, but after suffering racism directed by other students, her parents moved them to the Presbyterian Chinese 

School, with classes taught in English. Wong also attended a [[Chinese school|Chinese language school]] on afternoons and 

Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of her childhood, filming for "[[flickers]]" began relocating from [[New York City]] to the Los Angeles area. 

Movies were being shot constantly in and around Wong's neighborhood and she soon began going to the [[Nickelodeon movie 

theater|Nickeoldeons]]. She became obsessed with the cinema and would skip school and use lunch money to attend theaters. At 

home she would act out her favorite scenes from films in front of a mirror.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Her favorite 

stars were [[Pearl White]] and [[Ruth Roland]]. Her father was not happy with her interest in films. He felt it interfered 

with her studies and when he found out she had skipped school for the nickelodeon, he would spank her with a [[bamboo]] 

stick.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Wong decided to pursue a career in film. At nine years of age, she walked 

up and begged filmmakers for parts, earning her the nickname "C.C.C." or "Curious Chinese Child."&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 

21.&lt;/ref&gt;

<turn_topicname>GAN review</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>This was fascinating to read; I'm truly pleased that such dedication was put into writing and researching such an important subject in cinema history. The article itself is well written for the most part, it follows the MOS and is factually accurate and verifiable as well as neutral and stable. It is certainly broad in its coverage and the images (most of which are either free or in the public domain) are lovely. I do have some suggestions on the prose:

The opening sentence is a little unwieldy. Stating that she was both the first "Chinese American movie star" and the first "Asian American star" seems repetitive, although I can see how they are different. Perhaps reword the last part and relocate it? "The first female Asian American celebrity (?), Wong..." Done
Her career spanned the silent movie era, the advent of the talkies and television, as well as starring roles on the stage, and in radio: verb disagreement here as "spanned" and "starring" do not fit. This could be split into two sentences or maybe reworded as such: "Her career spanned the silent movie era and the advent of the talkies and television; she also appeared in starring roles on the stage and in radio." Done
In Hollywood she acted with Marlene Dietrich in Josef von Sternberg's Shanghai Express, one of Wong's best-remembered film roles: terms such as "best-remembered" definitely require citation so as to not seem POV, but is this sentence even needed since Shanghai Express is already mentioned in the previous paragraph? Done
Addressed repetition, but citation still needed. --Red Sunset 21:21, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
The last sentence of the lead bothers me. Rather than stating the obvious ("first Asian American star" is already repetitive), I think the examples ("three major literary works and major film retrospectives") can just speak for themselves. Done
There is a lot of time spent of Wong's family, their origins, occupations, etc. If you're looking to trim info, that may be a good place to start -- we're writing Anna May Wong's biography, not her forefathers and mothers. :) Done
Some trimming done. --Red Sunset 21:21, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
There were now two hills between the new home and Chinatown; this helped influence Wong to assimilate further into American culture: the way that this reads now, it sounds like the hills helped influence Wong to assimilate instead of the distance from Chinatown. How about "Two hills stood between the family's new home and Chinatown; this separation helped influence..."? Done
she received her first leading role, and was officially "discovered" in the early Metro Technicolor movie, The Toll of the Sea: is "officially 'discovered'" necessary here? Isn't that what "first leading role" denotes? Done
After this second breakout role... is there such a thing? Perhaps state the year instead for some context? Done
It had become evident by now that Wong's career would continue to be limited by anti-miscegenation laws that existed all over the U.S. at the time. This is a good example of redundancies in the prose throughout; it isn't grammatically incorrect, but removing such wordiness can help remove some of the bulk in the article and stave off prose snobs in the future. "It soon became evident that Wong's career would be continuously limited by American anti-miscegenation laws." Done
mostly white actors would play in yellowface": missing quotation mark. Done
The New York Times, for example, called Wong "splendid" in her minor role in Forty Winks (1925).[34] Disappointed with Hollywood's treatment of her: it's confusing to have these two sentences back to back. One may be led to think that Wong was disappointed with such glowing reviews, which I know wasn't the case. Give it context; what "treatment"? Done~~
Reworded slightly. --Red Sunset 21:21, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
In the UK in 1929, Wong made what is today considered her finest movie, Piccadilly. This needs a source. Done
In both America and Europe Wong had by now been seen as a fashion icon for over a decade: comma after "Europe". Done
The "Legacy" section is bloated; much attention is paid to two different people's ideas of the three most important aspects of Wong's career. Rather than he said, she said, this section should deal in facts. "Wong is remembered for" and not "So-and-so believes that Wong is remembered for." A lot of this can be cut down drastically.  Done I believe we did reduce the bloat. EraserGirl (talk) 18:23, 2 May 2008 (UTC)
Some copy-editing from non-involved editors would help eliminate some of the prose redundancies that I mentioned above, especially if you plan on taking this to FAC. All you need to concentrate on in order for me to promote, however, are the above concerns. Let me know if there are any questions/comments or if you need further clarification. Overall, this is a very detailed (perhaps overly so) article and I greatly enjoyed reading it. Great work! María (habla conmigo) 14:16, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

Dekkappai, since I have not actually made any textural contributions, just voiced opinions, I could take a stab at smoothing this prose unless someone else feels they have a better handle on it. Just holler if I can help. EraserGirl (talk) 16:18, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
Please go ahead. FWiW Bzuk (talk) 18:39, 28 April 2008 (UTC).
Just taken a quick run through to cover most of the above points, but over to EG for polishing. --Red Sunset 19:40, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
I will take a pass at smoothing the language but make no structural changes, I swear. Here's my Sandbox.EraserGirl (talk) 20:24, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

You should remove the categories and similar categorizing templates from your sandbox version so it won't be taken for a duplicate article. Also, it would be helpful for me to affirm progression if contributors were to either strike my above comments or add {{done}} beneath the individual bullet points when completed. Again, I don't think a full copy-edit is needed in order to be promoted to GA status, so just let me know when the above has been adequately addressed. Thanks, María (habla conmigo) 20:38, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
Oh, and you guys may find User:Tony1/How to satisfy Criterion 1a helpful for tips in how to reduce prose redundancies. I think it should be required reading for all college students. :) If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. María (habla conmigo) 20:51, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
I'm only online for a few minutes today-- so I'll just poke my nose in here quick-- to say thanks to everyone addressing the concerns brought up in the review. I'll be happy to help with any work still needing to be done tomorrow. Dekkappai (talk) 22:18, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

I bagged the idea of a sandbox version, every time I came back to paste stuff in, things had changed. I will just work 1 small section at a time, that should reduce edit conflicts and let people fix anything of mine they don't like right away. EraserGirl (talk) 22:23, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
I polished down to Move to Europe section, but its late here, if ya'll don't mind I will finish the other half tomorrow. So be my guest if you want to take a pass at the top half. I have trouble seeing periods and commas on a backlighted screen. To make some room I have been trying to remove redundancies and information not directly related to the subject, but anything larger than a few words i merely commented out, in case someone disagrees with me. Quite a few paras were unrelated sentences grouped together, so it may LOOK longer, but really isn't. EraserGirl (talk) 03:11, 29 April 2008 (UTC)

I finished what I could do, if anyone wants to unpolish my polish. I did comment out another paragraph that was completely about her family, but I moved the most important sentence in it to a later section. Dekkappai and Bzuk are going after the Legacy section. EraserGirl (talk) 03:19, 30 April 2008 (UTC)
Why does the text above need to have the strike-through line? Is the tick enough? I think that is is best that editors do not strike out other editors text. Snowman (talk) 13:41, 3 May 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
