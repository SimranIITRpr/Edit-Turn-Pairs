<edit_text>==Smear campaign==
On July 23, 2018, an article in [[Dainik Jagran]] cited former Super 30 students who said that only three students from the program had passed the IIT JEE exam that year, contrary to Kumar's claim that 26 had passed.&lt;ref name="India Today"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/patna-super-30-anand-kumar-1293475-2018-07-23|title=Patna's Super 30 mentor Anand Kumar accused of deceit to gain popularity|date=2018-07-23|work=[[India Today]]|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also claimed that students who sought to enroll in Super 30 were pushed to enroll in another coaching center called Ramanuj Institute, a for-profit institution, on the pretext that Kumar would coach them if they performed well. Furthermore, the article alleged that by asking IIT aspirants to enroll in Ramanuj Institute, Kumar made over Rs 1 crore annually.&lt;ref name="India Today" /&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname> I changed 'smear campaign' into 'fraud accusation' why it was reverted?[edit]</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>IHi @britishfinance, I changed 'smear campaign' into 'fraud accusation' because there were several media sources and court record as well which I had cited too. I respect Anand Kumar for what he's doing but wants to show people that there is controversial side as well. 'Smear campaign' doesn't sound so clear. The content I had added (mostly from Indian news articles) gives a picture that the allegations has been put by Anand Kumar's students about him being not 100% honest and what people have portrayed him might not be true. The statement of advocate discuss that he has not replied to PIL while the Court website show that the case is pending and ongoing. I think these details should be there on Wikipedia so people know both side of stories. I am not a good writer but I tried to write in unbiased tone and mostly gave citation for everything I wrote. I am not sure why it was removed. Could you please tell me? Thanks. (Also being inexperienced user of Wikipedia, I don't know how to quote you here so you can see my comment but will recheck) Creepy.clown.wiki (talk) 15:55, 14 July 2019 (UTC)

Per my edit to your reversion (and discussion above with another editor), the allegations against Kumar are (1) unproven, and (2) considered a "smear campaign" by notable people in WP:RS (per the article), and (3) are also considered a "smear campaign" by the BLP themselves. Per WP:BLP and WP:SUSPECT, such unproven allegations are not suitable for the BLP page of a subject; a Wikipedia BLP cannot be used as a platform to introduce or promote such unproven allegations, regardless of the sources. Also note that per a major ArbCom ruling here Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Gamaliel and others#Edit warring and BLP, editors who "restore" content removed due to BLP violations, face sanctions.

A "smear" implies unfounded and malicious rumor. An "allegation" is a legal term, and it is presumed false until and unless proven otherwise. Since an Indian state High Court agreed to hear a legal case against Anand Kumar, the term "allegation" would be appropriate. Sooku (talk) 00:38, 18 July 2019 (UTC)
It has been called a "smear campaign" by several notable sources in good WP:RS. We have to go by what notable sources say, AND also avoid BLP violations; only after a formal conviction, can we introduce such material into a BLP (e.g. a BLP cannot be used as a platform to promote unproven "allegation" against a subject); as yet, these "allegations" are not proven, and hearing a case is not a "conviction".
