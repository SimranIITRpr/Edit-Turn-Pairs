<edit_comment>/* 1987&amp;amp;ndash;1992: Final years and death */ reinserting the diet fact, with a reference</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Already in the course of the eighties, Cage's health worsened progressively: he suffered not only from arthritis, but also from sciatica and arteriosclerosis. He suffered a stroke that left the movement of his left leg restricted, and, in 1985, broke an arm. <strong><strike>E</strike></strong><strong>Cage was able to counter much of the effects of aging by pursuing a [[macrobiotic diet]].&lt;ref&gt;Revill 1993, 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, e</strong>ver since arthritis started plaguing him, the composer was aware of his age, and, as biographer David Revill observed, &quot;the fire which he began to incorporate in his visual work in 1985 is not only the fire he has set aside for so long&amp;mdash;the fire of passion&amp;mdash;but also fire as transitoriness and fragility.&quot; On 11 August 1992, while preparing evening tea for himself and Cunningham, Cage suffered another stroke. He was taken to the nearest hospital, where he died on the morning of 12 August.&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz, Richard. 2000. John Cage: Writer: Selected Texts, xvii. Cooper Square Press, 2nd edition. ISBN 978-0815410348&lt;/ref&gt; According to his wishes, Cage's body was cremated, and the ashes scattered in Ramapo Mountains, near Stony Point, NY;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the same place where Cage scattered the ashes of his parents, years before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revill 228&quot; /&gt; The composer's death occurred only weeks before a celebration of his 80th birthday organized in Frankfurt by the composer Walter Zimmermann and the musicologist Stefan Schaedler was due to take place. However, the event went ahead as planned, including a performance of the Concert for Piano and Orchestra by David Tudor and Ensemble Modern.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Merce Cunningham outlived his partner by 17 years, and died peacefully in his home, of natural causes, on 26 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>I removed "Cage was able to counter much of the effects of aging by pursuing a macrobiotic diet" from this section, since it was unsubstantiated, and not very credible given the 79-year-old's list of afflictions: "Already in the course of the eighties, Cage's health worsened progressively: he suffered not only from arthritis, but also from sciatica and arteriosclerosis. He suffered a stroke that left the movement of his left leg restricted, and, in 1985, broke an arm. Cage was able to counter much of the effects of aging by pursuing a macrobiotic diet." font-size: smaller;autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by 142.167.122.225 (talk) 20:28, 13 October 2009 (UTC) The statement is from Revill's 1993 biography. I just looked it up and reinserted it, adding a reference with the page number. --Jashiin (talk) 20:31, 13 October 2009 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
