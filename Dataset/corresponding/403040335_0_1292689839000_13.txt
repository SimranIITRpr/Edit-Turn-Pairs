<turn_topicname>Change Factbox of image</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>I think the image in the description box should be changed to this: File:Dl767.jpg Reason: Delta has changed its livery and is still a large 767 operator. Jhz94 18:21, 18 December 2010 (CET) Please dont change the image until after the discussion if you get a consensus. Dont see it should be changed the current image gives a reasonable airborne impression of the aircraft. The livery doesnt have to be up to date as this is an encyclopedia and a historical image is fine it is the view of the aircraft that is more important. MilborneOne (talk) 17:30, 18 December 2010 (UTC) A livery change is no reason to change the lead image of an aircraft article. An image with new livery should be included in the Delta article though. --Denniss (talk) 19:40, 18 December 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
