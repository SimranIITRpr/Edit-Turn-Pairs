<edit_text>On September 22,2006, Bonds tied Henry Aaron's National League career home run record of 733.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The home run came in the top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the Milwaukee Brewers, at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began (with the Milwaukee Braves) and concluded (with the Brewers, then in the American League) his career. With the Giants trailing 10–8, Bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2–0 pitch off the Brewers' Chris Spurling with runners on first and second and one out. Though the Giants were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the playoffs, Bonds' home run provided the additional drama of giving the Giants an 11–10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The Brewers eventually won the game, 13–12, despite Bonds' going 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.<strong>&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260922108|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=[[2006-09-22]]|title=Bonds ties Aaron's NL HR mark, but Giants fall to Brewers|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;</strong></edit_text>

The vast majority of the "San Francisco Giants (1993–2007)" section needs a lot more sources.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 18:10, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
"2005 season" part needs a lot more sources.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 20:37, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

"2007 season" part looks OK with sources, but this part needs source: "Bonds concluded the 2007 season with a .276 batting average, 28 home runs, and 66 RBIs in 126 games and 340 at bats. At the age of 43, he led both leagues in walks with 132."--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 12:13, 5 April 2008 (UTC)
Need source for the last part of the "Players' Union" section.Could not find source, but hid text in comments.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 21:42, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
"Bonds on Bonds" needs sourcing and a little expansion.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 22:05, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
"Personal life" needs expanding to at least a decent paragraph. --TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 23:32, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
Where do all the facts from the "Career Distinction" section come from? Needs sourcing.
We don't need that many links in the "See also" part IMO.I have removed the only two that don't have articles. I think everyone on any of the remaining lists should have it linked in their see also section.--TonyTheTiger (t/c/bio/WP:CHICAGO/WP:LOTD) 22:12, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
I'm failing the article, as finding sources for some of these may take quite a bit of time. Re-nominate at WP:GAN when the problems have been rectified. Regards, D.M.N. (talk) 14:34, 25 March 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
