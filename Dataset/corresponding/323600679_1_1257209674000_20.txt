<edit_comment>Awkward sentence about awards. Film did not &amp;quot;inspire&amp;quot; series, but succeeded it</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Filming took place at Pinewood Studios from October 1988 to January 1989. The budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million, while the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike forced Hamm to drop out. Uncredited rewrites were performed by Warren Skaaren, Charles McKeown and Jonathan Gems. Batman was a critical and financial success, earning over $400 million in box office totals. The film received numerous nominations a<strong><strike>t the [[62nd Academy Awards]], [[47th Golden Globe</strike></strong><strong>nd was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy</strong> Awards]] and Saturn Awards. It has also inspired Batman: The Animated Series, a series of films for Warner Bros. and redefined the modern perception of the superhero film genre.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Sentence about awards was re-written for clarity. Original sentence made it look like there were many Academy Award nominations when there was only one. --Davmpls 01:54, 3 November 2009 (UTC) Movie not shown to have "inspired" animated series, but did "succeed" it. POV edit. --Davmpls 01:54, 3 November 2009 (UTC) autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by Davmpls (talk • contribs) Um...thanks. You didn't need to bring this to the talk page though. Simply putting it in your edit summary, which you did, is fine. Just so you know. Anakinjmt (talk) 04:04, 3 November 2009 (UTC)Well, you never know. Some people get very agitated if you edit anything. Better to say it and explain it.Davmpls 14:49, 3 November 2009 (UTC) autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by Davmpls (talk • contribs)</turn_topictext>
