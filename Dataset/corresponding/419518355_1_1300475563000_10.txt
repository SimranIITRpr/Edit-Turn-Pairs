<edit_comment>Figure of 420,003 is in dispute so this number cannot be stated as a fact as there is a significant chance that it is wrong. The most factual and accurate way to state it is that it is the census figure.</edit_comment>

<turn_topictext>This article is about the city of Atlanta in its entirity, covering its history, culture, economy, etc. The Lead is to be a brief summary of the basic salient points of the article. I can't see how the population dispute merits a mention in the second line of the article. I agree it needs to be covered, but that should be done in the main text of the article, which is where the other editor moved it. Be sure the section includes the other viewpoint, which is that the estimate my have been too high, and that many federal dollars are based on a city's population, which is the root of the cause of the outcry by the mayor. - BilCat (talk) 20:12, 18 March 2011 (UTC) Actually I moved it to the Demographics section in deference to your remarks that it shouldn't be in the lead. I trust that there is no problem with indicating it is a census figure and cannot for the moment be stated as a fact. You are right that federal dollars are one reason to be upset, but it is only an opinion that that is why the mayor is contesting the census results. Atlanta is the only city in the country with such a gap between estimates and 2010 census figures. And anyone who lives in the City of Atlanta knows that the intown parts of the City have been growing fast and so analysis is required as to how growth could be virtually zero since 2000.Keizers (talk) 20:39, 18 March 2011 (UTC) I would have to agree that it belongs in the demographics section. A lead is no place for disputed facts, and discrepancies. The lead should state the census data and the demographics should state the discrepancies and theories.

<turn_text>I am concerned that the demographics of the city are actually incorrect. The study cited is skewed base on a population that does not even exist. Whats more is that the U S Census bureau says something quite different. Furthermore, the initial commentator is correct about the ranking of White first. THERE is NO precedent set that does that. Such is BULL and you know it! font-size: smaller;autosignedâ€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 64.195.178.6 (</turn_text>
