<edit_comment>/* Plot */ this synospsis suggests toxic waste killed Penguin- there is no evidence of this in the film- it is very disputable what actually killed him, changed text to be more accurate</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Realising that Batman has found him, Cobblepot attempts to flee from the sewer through the zoo, but Batman catches up with him and they fight until Batman tricks Cobblepot into firing the penguins' missiles at the zoo. In the fray, Cobblepot falls into a pool of toxic waste and is apparently killed<strong> when he falls through the glass ceiling and plummets into the water below</strong>. Shreck, meanwhile, escapes but is ambushed by Catwoman. Batman intervenes and tries to talk Catwoman out of it, but she refuses to listen. Shreck pulls out a gun, shoots Batman (who is wearing body armour) and proceeds to shoot Catwoman several times until she has only two lives left. Barely able to stand, she sacrifices her penultimate life to ignite an explosion which kills Shreck, and destroys the giant air-conditioning/cooling system within the lair. Batman tries to find her body, but is unsuccessful. Cobblepot, barely alive, emerges from the toxic waste and tries to shoot Batman from behind, but collapses dead before he can get the chance, after muttering that the &quot;heat's getting to me,&quot; implying that his cold-blooded body (he earlier states that he is, in fact, cold blooded) could not take the stress of the rocket attack, the fall and the destruction of the air-cooling unit. The penguins gather around him and slowly push his body back into the pool as a burial.</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>The article has been reading lately that toxic waste killed the penguin. This is rubbish. The area where he landed was right where the penguins had been swimming moments before, and obviously, he wouldn't let his penguins swim in toxic waste. So, when he falls there, it can be easilly deduced that stress from the fight, the fall, and the destruction of the giant air-cooler (which Catwoman destroys) is actually what killed him. Not that toxic waste magically materialized there. Plus, he stated earlier that he is cold blooded, and right before he dies, he claims "The heat's getting to me," which is further evidence that the stress and heat is what killed him. MaximumMadnessStixon (talk) 19:25, 10 October 2009 (UTC) Then it´s (at least) an illogical goof, since he was born into a regular environment and lived as a baby together with his parents in a regular tempered house and in their rooms. It´s impossible and quite stupid to suggest a warm-blooded creature turns into an cold blooded one, only because he lives for some years in an cold environment. So it´s a flaw of the script. --93.135.109.107 (talk) 11:24, 14 February 2010 (UTC) But, he could've gotten really used to cold environments since, and his hideout probably wasn't just room temperature, it was probably HOT, because of the missiles hitting it... autosigned—Preceding unsigned comment added by Emeeme2003 (talk • contribs) 21:36, 14 February 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
