<turn_topictext>For those unaware (since I saw it used as a source a couple of times in the article), Heroic Hollywood isn't a reliable source. They are notoriously click baity and have been known to post misinformation. DarkKnight2149 00:50, 31 March 2019 (UTC)

Really? I coulda sworn someone told me it was reliable in the past (might be mistaking it with another source). I'll cull 'em. JOEBRO64 00:52, 31 March 2019 (UTC)
I think I've got most of them. I think I only added one or two of them myself (I had to do tons of work to get this article where it is now; this is what it used to look like and I kept getting reverted by a sockpuppet troll). JOEBRO64 01:02, 31 March 2019 (UTC)
You might be thinking of The Hollywood Reporter. THR, Deadline Hollywood and Variety are the three most trusted sources in the film/TV industry. Good work on the article overall, though.
I myself have dealt with a fair share of sock puppet trolls, the most severe case being in 2016 with the Nolantron incident, which went on non-stop for several months. I can sympathise there. DarkKnight2149 05:25, 31 March 2019 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
