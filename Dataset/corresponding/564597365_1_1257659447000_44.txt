<turn_topictext>Do not misunderstand me, this is by NO means an insult to Daniel and his work, but his manner of speech, his writing style, and aspects of his current lifestyle all seem to point to the possiablity that he may also be autistic and suffering from some other metal illness then simply bi-poler syndrom. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 69.250.130.215 (talk) 20:04, 12 September 2007 (UTC)


Personally, I still like the old term manic-depressive.George415 00:34, 3 October 2007 (UTC)

I agree that he's probably autistic, but that's mere speculation, not a publicized diagnosis. Bleedingcherub (talk) 06:08, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

The page says Daniel suffers from Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia, I think this should be changed to Bipolar Disorder only. There is no mention of schizophrenia in any official resource I have come across and the Boston Globe article cited does not mention his bipolar disorder, so this could most likely be put down to a mistake by the writer.

This article also mentions that he has schizophrenia.--Gloriamarie (talk) 08:52, 2 August 2008 (UTC)
As I understand it, Bi-Polar Disorder (and I agree "Manic-Depressive" sounds better, plus Daniel himself uses the term in one of his early songs) is the only thing he's been "officially" diagnosed with; from a personal speculation standpoint, I disagree strongly with the autism conjecture, though Dan unarguably does have a very "childlike" aesthetic sensibility and sense of humor. Daniel seems without a doubt to be (to me) schizophrenic. Compare him to Roky Erickson, another musician sometimes lumped into the "Outsider Artist" category, and a diagnosed schizophrenic... In my opinion, if any one thing explains the incredible genius of Daniel's work, it's his schizophrenia. BUT, all that said, since he's never been officially diagnosed as anything other than Manic-Depressive, seems like that's the only mental illness Wiki should list. --Mikey 11:49, 7 January 2010 (UTC) —Preceding unsigned comment added by 67.78.80.22 (talk)

i'm taking down the dubious statement about lsd in the introduction. no one ever said acid "caused" daniel johnston's illness, and it's well documented that the drug can exacerbate existing psychological conditions. if someone can find a citation for this statement, AND demonstrate why it has a place in this article's introductory paragraph, revert it. peterpumpkin87 —Preceding undated comment added 20:16, 17 January 2010 (UTC).

Schizophrenia does seem like a strong possibility, given his fascination with peculiar iconography and what looks like a shaky grasp on reality. The LSD didn't cause the mental problems, but it exacerbated them -- I don't have the precise citation, unfortunately, but this was mentioned in a Daily Texan feature back around 1988 or so.
On a different subject but possibly of interest to some of you, he sold corn dogs at carnivals when he was in West Virginia. In Austin, he worked for a while (this would be about 1986) in either the Burger King or the McDonald's in Dobie Tower, which is on the opposite corner of the former record store where his cassettes were sold. This is the location of the "Peace Frog" mural you see in this article. When it was turned into a restaurant, local citizens held a collection to pay them to preserve that part of the wall.

Schizophrenia with a co-occurring mood disorder (bipolar) is called "Schizoaffective." To say he's been diagnosed with both in the past can be correct, but he wouldn't hold both diagnosis at the same time as it would default to schizoaffective. As far speculation, I agree autism doesn't fit the childlike nature. There's possibly some developmental stuff going on.</turn_topictext>
