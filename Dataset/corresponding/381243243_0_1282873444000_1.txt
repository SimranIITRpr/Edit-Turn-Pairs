<edit_text>A small part of land of the City of Atlanta was once an American Indian village called &quot;Standing Peachtree&quot; (translated into the English language). The land that became the Atlanta Metropolitan Area was <strong><strike>taken away</strike></strong><strong>obtained</strong> from the Cherokee Indians and Creek Indians by white settlers and their armies in 1822, with the first white settlement established in the area being Decatur.

<turn_topictext>Okay, if we're going to bring up the Trail of Tears and the "ejection" of natives in the areas, then it needs its own section and needs to be written without needles. I myself am part Apache, but get off the high horse here. What's done is done and it needs to be written in a non-biased and cohesive manner. History is just that, history. It means it is done and over with. Let's move along and document it properly without stupid bitterness. MagnoliaSouth (talk) 03:32, 27 August 2010 (UTC) I removed the weasel words such as "forced exile" with a simple "exile" since exile is rarely voluntary and removed the "taken away" comment and replaced it with "obtained". Now if you want to write a section on how this was done and how natives were affected, then fine. Go for it. Otherwise there is no reason to include bitter words here. The article loses credibility with descriptive words like that. Either make a case, or replace. That my motto. MagnoliaSouth (talk) 03:44, 27 August 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
