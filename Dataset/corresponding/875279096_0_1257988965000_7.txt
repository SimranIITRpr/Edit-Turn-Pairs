<turn_topictext>i've added a paragraph about his work, under 'Career'. I have tried to explain his approach in a simple manner. I don't know BLP fully, so can someone rewrite this in a more encyclopaedic tone? Also, does anyone have more references to his work (other than his lab's website)? --Jose Mathew (talk) 15:49, 15 October 2019 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
