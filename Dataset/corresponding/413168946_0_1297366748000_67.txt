<edit_text><strong><strike>'''Antibodies''' (</strike></strong><strong>An '''antibody''' </strong>also known as immunoglobulins,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8450761&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviated Ig) are gamma globulin proteins that are found in blood or an infected cell for attack by other bodily fluids of vertebrates, and are used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects, such as bacteria and viruses. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains—to form, for example, monomers with one unit, dimers with two units or pentamers with five units. Antibodies are produced by a kind of white blood cell called a plasma cell. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter.&lt;ref name=Market&gt;Eleonora Market, F.

<turn_topicname>Simplify lead</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>A concern has been raised here that this article is not as clear as it could be. Please note that the first paragraph in the lead needs to be kept dead simple so that anyone can understand it. Looking back to a http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antibody&amp;oldid=119979646 at the time it was promoted to good article status, the first paragraph is in my opinion significantly clearer. Would anyone object if I try to restore some of the language of the previous version of the lead? In addition, I suggest that some of the more detailed description concerning antibody structure that is currently in the first paragraph of the lead could be split out into a new paragraph. Boghog (talk) 11:05, 6 February 2011 (UTC) Since no one has commented, I was bold and went ahead and edited the lead so that it now hopefully clearer. Boghog (talk) 20:39, 10 February 2011 (UTC) I think it's an improvement. Thanks for doing that. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:09, 15 February 2011 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
