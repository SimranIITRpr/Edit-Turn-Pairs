<turn_topicname>New Section Impact</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>I have added a section on the economic impact because of its relevancy to understanding the nature of bushfires and their social and regional impact in Australia. Link from methodological to empiricism to provide individuals with a way to delve deeper into the thought process that garners the the list of items that are expected to be impacted.
