<turn_topictext>hello all, not entirely sure how editing on here works but i wanted to bring to your attention that “everything i wanted” is not a single off of “when we all fall asleep, where do we go?” though it is listed as such. have fun doing your thing on here, and sorry that i most likely did not point this out appropriately!

argh, meant song, not single** Mango Overlord (talk) 02:10, 28 December 2019 (UTC)

Eh you’re right, it was a bonus track that appears to have been released as a promotional single or something like that but not one of the official singles of the album. I will put a note. Trillfendi (talk) 14:24, 29 December 2019 (UTC)
It is specifically listing songs from the album. "Everything I Wanted" has nothing to do with the album so it shouldn't be there in the first place. Even if a note is added, it will just result in more confusion. heyitsben!! talk 13:39, 30 December 2019 (UTC)
You are right but Billie has uploaded wwafawdwg on Spotify and the single everything I wanted is part of the album Mario Fejzo (talk) 09:33, 22 July 2020 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
