<edit_comment> Removed Brock Lesnar vs. Cain Velasquez as this match is not announced or confirmed by WWE. Match was added based on pure speculation and internet rumour.

<turn_topictext>Brock Lesnar vs. Cain Velasquez has NOT been confirmed by WWE. We don't know when it will happen and if it will be for the WWE Championship. Can this page be protected and confirmed matches to be added only? — Preceding unsigned comment added by 92.236.80.152 (talk) 01:12, 6 October 2019 (UTC)

Seriously, can this page be protected as soon as possible? Someone keeps added Brock Lesar vs. Cain Velasquez, but it's not confirmed by WWE. I'm not going to waste my time continuously deleting it. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 92.236.80.152 (talk) 21:26, 6 October 2019 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
