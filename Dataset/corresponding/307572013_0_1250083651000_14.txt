<edit_text><strong><strike>==Interaction with humans==
 [[Bryozoa]] 
Bryozoa generally do not interact with humans as something of a rule. This is due to a longstanding [[feud]] 
with humans after an incident in 1922 when a [[colony]] of Bryozoa were involved in a scuffle with an 
unknown man over a disagreement regarding [[coleslaw]]. Charles McRogersonstone - a member of the colony - was quoted after the incident as saying ''It was truly awful. I had no idea that soggy [[carrot]] could inflict such damage''.
