<turn_topictext>Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) - I am now bringing this topic to the talk-page. Regardless of how many editors have reverted the primary source (directly from the film studio), the title listing on the article is still incorrect. Regardless of pronouns vs nouns, as has been pointed out in the edit comments there - a film studio, or any creative output, can "stylize" a title however they want. Placing limitations on titles, is derisory to those who make the product. An example can be shown in Spider-Man: Far From Home title. usually 'from' would not have a capital 'F', but because it is the official title as released by Marvel Studios - the title reflects the same here. My argument is obviously, that the title here should reflect the studio's official name for the film. WB announced the film with a lowercase 'o' in 'one', and therefore the title is such. I don't see a logical nor reasonable alternative. What are the arguments against this?--DisneyMetalhead (talk) 17:10, 1 October 2019 (UTC)

The "F" in Far From Home is capitalized because verbs in creative titles are capitalized. The "O" in "One" is no different. Your personal preference doesn't override Wikipedia policy. JOEBRO64 18:23, 1 October 2019 (UTC)
As others have said, Wikipedia policy is that the 'O' be capitalized here. Worth noting that your assertion regarding WB's official stylizing may not be correct any way - on warnerbros.co.uk, it is written as 'One' - [[1]]. AutumnKing (talk) 18:33, 1 October 2019 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
