==Relationships==
In 2007, Hernandez began dating Shayanna Jenkins, a girl he had known since elementary school. Their daughter was born in 2012,[135] the same month that the couple became engaged and that Hernandez purchased a $1.3 million, 8,130 square foot (755 m2), four-story home with an in-ground pool in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, where the family lived together.[19][136] Jenkins moved in with Hernandez in 2011, during his second season with the Patriots.[19]

After she discovered him cheating on her, Jenkins moved out but returned in the summer of 2012.[19] During Hernandez's trial for the murder of Odin Lloyd, it was claimed that Hernandez had flirted with and kissed the nanny who took care of his daughter.[137] Jenkins testified in court that she wanted to make their relationship work, and that it required her to compromise on some of his behavior.[138] She told police that she cooked and cleaned and she knew her role.[19] Hernandez and Jenkins never married.[139]

==Sexuality==
Following Hernandez's death, a high school teammate, Dennis SanSoucie, described a secret homosexual relationship between the two between the 7th and 11th grades.[9][16] The teammate stated that Hernandez had many sexual partners during this time.[16] Hernandez's brother D.J., mother Terri, and attorney George Leontire report that Hernandez came out as gay to his mother and ex-girlfriend while in prison.[10][81][112][140] Leontire, who is also gay,[15] said his client "clearly was gay" and described the "immense pain that it caused him" and the self-hatred that came from growing up in a culture that was anti-gay.[141] According to Leontire, Hernandez believed that the sexual abuse he experienced as a boy caused him to become gay.[142][143] A college girlfriend said that "he never dealt with [the sexual abuse]. It led to issues in his sexuality."[141] SanSoucie stated that Hernandez was terrified that his father would find out about his homosexuality.[144]

After listening to more than 300 recorded phone calls, The Boston Globe reported that Hernandez was "prone to going on homophobic rants" and that, in one phone call, he admitted he was attracted to men and said it made him "angry all the time."[81] Patriots receiver Brandon Lloyd said that he had been warned by teammate Wes Welker that Hernandez would expose his genitalia and talk about gay sex.[19]

Prosecutors threatened to raise the issue of his sexuality during the 2012 double homicide trial, a prospect that frightened Hernandez.[81][141] He wished to keep his sexuality a secret.[106] After his death, Jenkins stated that she saw no indication that he was gay.[140][145] She said, "I wish I had known how he felt, just so we could have talked about it. I wouldn't have disowned him. I would have been supportive."[145]

==Paranoia==
D.J. described Hernandez as growing increasingly paranoid as an adult, believing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and others were out to get him.[10] D.J. said that Hernandez slept with a large knife by his bed and collected a number of weapons for protection.[10] After the 2013 shooting of Alexander Bradley, Hernandez hired a friend from Bristol, Connecticut to serve as his bodyguard 24 hours a day.[69] He also began acquiring a large number of weapons and installed a sophisticated surveillance system in his home.[15] Shortly thereafter, Hernandez approached Coach Bill Belichick "in a state of deepening paranoia," saying he feared for his family's safety.[19] Hernandez's agent testified that Hernandez requested the meeting because he was in fear for his life.[69] Hernandez requested a transfer to a team on the other side of the country, but the request was denied.[69]

In April 2013, Hernandez purchased a used car with two handguns and two rifles inside.[69] He also purchased a Chevrolet Suburban that had been outfitted as an armored car.[69] He had secret compartments installed in vehicles to store firearms.[33] When being driven, he refused to travel in cars without tinted windows for fear that one of his enemies might see him.[69] Teammates said that Hernandez was prone to wild mood swings and became more agitated as time went on.[19] He was said to go from being hyper-masculine to talking about cuddling with his mother.[19] As a Patriot, he smoked large quantities of marijuana and used other drugs, including cocaine.[19]

==Brain damage==
After his death, researchers at Boston University studied Hernandez's brain and diagnosed him with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), stage 3 of 4,[8][146][147] and described Hernandez's brain as a classic case of the pathology.[147][148][149] CTE is caused by repeated head trauma.[8] Hernandez had two confirmed concussions since he began playing football at eight years old, but the Boston Globe believes "he undoubtedly took other punishing hits to the head that were never recorded."[8] CTE is associated with cumulative injuries. In a phone conversation recorded in prison, Hernandez said "I'm like a grandpa. All my bones are so sore."[33]

The researchers suggested that the CTE, which results in poor judgment, lack of impulse control, or aggression, anger, paranoia, emotional volatility, and rage behaviors, may explain some of Hernandez's criminal acts and other behavior.[8][146] Sam Gandy of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York said, "It's impossible for me to look at the severity of CTE and Mr. Hernandez's brain and not think that that had a profound effect on his behavior."[8] Hernandez suffered from migraines in prison, and had trouble with memory.[8] Jose Baez wrote that he saw symptoms consistent with CTE from his earliest meetings with Hernandez: Hernandez sometimes showed keen insight and observational skills, while other times he had gaps in memory that were highly unusual for a young person.[82]

After release of the Boston University statement, Hernandez's fianc√©e and daughter sued the Patriots and the NFL for causing Hernandez's death and depriving his daughter of her father's companionship, arguing that Hernandez's NFL career had caused what researchers described as "the most severe case of [CTE] medically seen" in a person at his age.[8][150] The suit was dismissed in February 2019 because the deadline to opt out of a class action suit against the league had been missed.[151]</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Brain Damage section</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>There appears to be a weak consensus for including brain damage information as part of a Personal life section, after the Death section. Vote counting was difficult due to there being a spectrum of positions which varied in how much they actually conflicted with each other. However, it seems that the concerns of most editors can be addressed by moving the personal life section after the death section, and including the brain damage information there. I'm going to go ahead and implement a naive version of this consensus by simply moving Brain damage to a subheader of Personal life, and then moving Personal life to after Death. However, further edits will likely be in order to better integrate the sections; I will leave that to editors who are more involved with the article. signed, Rosguill talk 18:01, 22 January 2020 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
