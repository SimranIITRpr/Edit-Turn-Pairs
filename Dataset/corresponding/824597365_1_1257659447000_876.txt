<turn_topicname>Gloria James Rumor</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext> Come on. This rumor has no supporting evidence whatsoever - should not be mentioned until AND unless it has a credible source. Rumors don't belong here, especially ones so clearly made up. 66.57.254.204 (talk) 03:22, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

85.127.165.144 (talk · contribs) has recently added a citation to The Daily Inquirer (here). I've reverted the edit but please can you check it out to see whether you think it is credible? Thanks - Pointillist (talk) 22:55, 15 May 2010 (UTC)
Well, that article includes a citation of Terez Owens. Terez Owens includes a citation of an anonymous source. That source says that their uncle is a contractor at the Q and is the actual source. So the supposed uncle of a source of a source of a source says this happened. Uh, no, I don't think that's reliable. The train includes a sport gossip site I've never heard of - at the bottom of their "exclusive" is a link to another "story" that Gloria James has a history of sleeping with LeBron's friends. This appears to be the point of origin of the rumor - an anonymous source with no qualifications or info whatsoever, reporting to a sports gossip blog, that his uncle told him something. Personally, I don't think this should be mentioned on the article until a credible source comes forth - like someone with evidence, something other than hearsay. Maybe that's just me though. 66.57.254.204 (talk) 03:48, 17 May 2010 (UTC)
A cease and desist letter has now been sent to the aforementioned website "source". Here is the text of the letter (per TMZ, numerous sports-blogs).
From “Nance, Frederick R.”

Subject “GLORIA JAMES”

“Mr. Owens. I am the attorney for Gloria and LeBron James. I am writing to demand that you Cease and Desist in repeating the lies you have been instrumental in spreading regarding Gloria James. They are categorically false and per se defamatory. If you do not understand the legal significance of those facts, I strongly urge you to consult your legal counsel.

At first blush, your irresponsible speculation about what might have contributed to the Cavaliers performance in the Boston series was so idiotic and “off the wall” that we did not think that it even warranted a denial. No thinking person could possibly believe such rubbish. But you have persisted in repeating this nonsense, attributing it to an unidentified source all for your own personal gain. We demand that you immediately stop publishing or in any way repeating these false, despicable and per se defamatory statements.

Frederick R. Nance”

The first sentence of the second paragraph sums up my feelings. Now that there's been an actual response by the parties involved, there's some citable info, but I don't think this warrants mention on Delonte's page. Anyone out there that does? 66.57.254.204 (talk) 19:42, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

There are definitely more interesting sources popping up now, but I might caution against inclusion until we know this thing has legs --i.e. it becomes something that is a serious part of his story as a notable person rather than say, a week of controversy that totally blows over. I have no opinion one way or the other at this moment in time; it's definitely interesting. --Bobak (talk) 20:17, 20 May 2010 (UTC)
Just to follow up on what I'm referring to, this piece by the Orlando Sentinel online puts it view:
Calvin Murphy says LeBron James mother and Delonte West relationship real. --Bobak (talk) 20:20, 20 May 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
