<edit_comment>/* History */ Weasel words removed (when is exile voluntary?) see discussion</edit_comment>
<edit_text>File:Peachtree1907.jpg On December 21, 1836, the Georgia General Assembly voted to build the Western and Atlantic Railroad to provide a trade route to the Midwestern United States.&lt;ref name=W&amp;ARR&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Trail of Tears<strong><strike> forced</strike></strong> exile of the Cherokee Nation to Oklahoma between 1838 and 1839, this depopulated area was opened up for the construction of railroads. The area around the eastern terminus of the town to the railroad began to develop first, and hence the settlement was named &quot;Terminus&quot; in 1837. It was nicknamed Thrasherville, for John Thrasher, a merchant who built homes and a general store here.&lt;ref&gt;http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/gahistmarkers/thrashervillehistmarker.htm, retrieved on 2009-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1842, the settlement had six buildings and 30 residents and the town was renamed &quot;Marthasville&quot;.&lt;ref name=shorthistory&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Engineer of the Georgia Railroad, J. Edgar Thomson, suggested that the area be renamed &quot;Atlantica-Pacifica&quot; after the Western and Atlantic Railroad, but this name was quickly shortened to &quot;Atlanta&quot;.&lt;ref name=shorthistory/&gt; The residents approved, and the town was incorporated as Atlanta on December 29, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By 1854, another railroad connected Atlanta to LaGrange, and the town grew to 9,554 by 1860.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>History > Natives</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Okay, if we're going to bring up the Trail of Tears and the "ejection" of natives in the areas, then it needs its own section and needs to be written without needles. I myself am part Apache, but get off the high horse here. What's done is done and it needs to be written in a non-biased and cohesive manner. History is just that, history. It means it is done and over with. Let's move along and document it properly without stupid bitterness. MagnoliaSouth (talk) 03:32, 27 August 2010 (UTC) I removed the weasel words such as "forced exile" with a simple "exile" since exile is rarely voluntary and removed the "taken away" comment and replaced it with "obtained". Now if you want to write a section on how this was done and how natives were affected, then fine. Go for it. Otherwise there is no reason to include bitter words here. The article loses credibility with descriptive words like that. Either make a case, or replace. That my motto. MagnoliaSouth (talk) 03:44, 27 August 2010 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
