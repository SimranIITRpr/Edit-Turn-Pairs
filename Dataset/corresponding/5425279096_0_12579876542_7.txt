<turn_topictext>Should Ricky Gervais's roast of Hollywood comments, in which he mentioned topics such as Jeffrey Epstein and compared Apple to ISIS, and which have drawn significant coverage(both praising his statements and criticising them), be mentioned in the Controversy section? This seems to have been the biggest news to come out of the ceremony. Colliric (talk) 23:47, 6 January 2020 (UTC)

It is mentioned now. The current section seems sufficient. </turn_topictext>
