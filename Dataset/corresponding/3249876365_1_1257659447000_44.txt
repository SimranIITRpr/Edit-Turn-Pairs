<edit_text> For instance, today on ABC she brought up the insightful and telling question of why Barack Obama would travel to Hawaii and not Florida. In displaying her geographic prowess, she conceded Hawaii was a state, but wondered how a presidential candidate would travel to such an exotic place and not Florida.

<turn_topictext>Shouldn't we mention her consistent extreme right-wing bias, which has been repeatedly, and factually documented on websites such as FAIR or Media Lens? To call Cokie Roberts a "journalist" is indeed a stretch of the imagination! She is in the same category as Sean Hannity, David Brooks, Ann Coulter, and Bill O'Reilly of Fox News: these people are not 'journalists' per se (in the traditional sense of the term, e.g. reporting news in a factual and objective manner--free of political bias); they are Republican shills, and/or public relations talk show personalities promoting conservative, corporate, Republican interests.



the "career" section is bit of a muddled mess. surely, some editor could put it in a more cohesive timeline. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.173.13.31 (talk) 08:12, 23 June 2008 (UTC)

Why oh why does where she vacation matter? And its racial makeup? inflammatory and undocumented.I cut it. The section on Obama is also biased. The actual words she used were not critical but I will let someone else work with that once the hysteria dies down. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 166.129.33.82 ([[User talk:166.129.33.82|talk]]) 06:10, 13 August 2008 (UTC)

What "hysteria" are you talking about? Oh! Now I get it: by "hysteria" you mean the reams of well-documented criticisms of Cokie Roberts by numerous members of Congress, public officials, media organizations, and in general people who value TRUTH AND ACCURACY in journalism. For you, "hysteria" here means anybody who tries to set the record straight after the latest smear by Roberts of...for example Barack Obama, or for that matter of any public official to the left of Dick Cheney who Cokie and neo-con friends in the D.C. beltway decide to target in her next public "shill sesh". Or to put it another way: any sane and reasonable person who dares to refute the hysterical, mudslinging Cokie Roberts.

I deleted the following:

Cokie is hated by millions of Americans who painfully endure her bug-eyed face on those insipid political TV shows like ABC's "This Week". Cokie is hated for her extreme right-wing viewpoints which border on the insane and racist. For example, Cokie recently attacked Barack Obama on ABC's "This Week" for visiting his ailing grandmother in Hawaii:

Roberts: …going off this week I know his grandmother lives in Hawaii and I know Hawaii is a state, but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign, exotic place. He should be at Myrtle Beach and if he’s going to take a vacation at this time. I just think this is not the time to do that.

So, Cokie disapproves of Barack Obama going to visit his ailing grandmother, and she also shows apparent disregard for the state of Hawaii--portraying the 50th state as a "foreign, exotic place" that somehow shouldn't be visited by presidential candidates who happen to be from there. WTF!? Hawaii Senator Daniel Akaka subsequently rebuked the bitter old hag Roberts for her arrogance and the sheer stupidity of her statements. But making such outlandish, crude comments as this is nothing new for Roberts, who always has a sneering, negative comment at the ready for anybody who is not a war-rabid, Bush enabling neo-con extremist.


It's pretty sad that someone (over the age of 12) would deliberately sabotage a biography article just because of a different political view! comment added by Usl1984

Usl1984: you're sounding pretty sad yourself...for somebody supposedly "over the age of 12". Or, maybe you don't like it when so many people (including members of Congress) criticize Cokie Roberts for trying in her ugly underhanded way to sabotage Barack Obama's campaign with such a lame criticism like where he goes for a vacation! Roberts is a shill for the GOP and uses the same ugly tactics as Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, etc. But more to the point: right-wing neo-con extremists are always happy to sling mud on liberals, democrats, and minorities--but whenever they get a taste of their own medicine they cry bloody murder! Ah, the glaring hypocrisy of it all. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.52.223.26 (talk) 17:27, 2 November 2008 (UTC)

If you knew anything about this country, you'd realize that most members of Congress have the brainpower of the keyboard I'm using to type this, and therefore have little room to criticize what anyone else says or does. Why do people hate free speech in this country so much nowadays?! Just because someone isn't a liberal, Communist, braindead shill of government takeovers and Obamaunism, they're somehow evil and inferior? —Preceding unsigned comment added by 74.202.255.7 (talk) 05:38, 4 July 2009 (UTC)
