<turn_topictext>I've gone ahead and created a new section with some basic background info. I thought it was relevant, esp considering the recent media coverage of Greg Hunt citing Wikipedia.[1] — Preceding unsigned comment added by Charbono (talk • contribs) 11:23, 24 October 2013 (UTC)

The citation for AR5 leads to n opinion piece, the AR5 itself is not able to be cited yet (Big bold letters at the bottom of every page). SWOldfield (talk) 08:58, 25 October 2013 (UTC)

Removed uncited assertion from introduction.

Edited false reference to CRC report to reflect actual content (and spirit) of report. Distinguished the statements made by CRC and CSIRO. SWOldfield (talk) 09:45, 25 October 2013 (UTC)

Moved superseding citation from introduction (2007 report) to section on climate change (outdated 2005 report) SWOldfield (talk) 10:05, 25 October 2013 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
