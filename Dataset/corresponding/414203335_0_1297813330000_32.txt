<turn_topictext>Shouldn't borax be wikilinked in the "etymology" paragraph? JCM83 It's already linked first in the lede and also later in the mineral section. I put in a third link, but that's three. Number of links for the same term in an article should be limited. Here it's when used for the first time, then then maybe when needed to stimulate the memory. A new one in etymology is okay with me, and then the section about borax minerals--- but that's it! blueSorangeBHarris 05:52, 16 February 2011 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
