<edit_text>Burton approached Sam Hamm, a comic book fan to write the screenplay.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Hamm decided not to use an origin story, feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that &quot;unlocking the mystery becomes part of the story&quot;.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; He reasoned, &quot;You totally destroy your credibility if you show the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hamm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. Englehart said it was &quot;decided Silver and Thorne were no longer well-enough known, so the names were changed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm completed his script in October 1986, which also featured a bitter rivalry between Bruce Wayne and Alexander Knox over Vicki Vale. Dick Grayson also made a cameo appearance<strong><strike>.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | author = [[Sam Hamm]] | url = http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/batman_early.html | title = Batman: First Draft | work = Daily Script | date = [[1986-10-20]] | accessdate = 2008-05-04}}&amp;lt;/ref</strike></strong><strong> by Dick Grayson.&lt;ref name=Storm/</strong>&gt; Once scene in Hamm's script had James Gordon on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. In this way, he shares a special bond with the adult Bruce and thus with Batman, similar with a subplot in Batman Begins. When Hamm's script was rewritten, the scene was deleted.&lt;ref name=heroes/&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topicname>Reliable Sources</turn_topicname>
<turn_topictext>Before I take this article to Featured Article Candidacy, I have to prove that the following websites are reliable sources: http://www.superherohype.com
http://www.snarkygossip.com
http://www.dailyscript.com
http://www.batmanytb.com
http://www.batman-on-film.com
http://www.scifiscripts.com
Since I have no way of explaining this, other than Being Bold, it's probably best to collect other opinions from editors. http://www.superherohype.com because it has its own page at Superhero Hype!, it that makes any sense. Batman-on-Film might pass since "Batman-related" filmmakers such as David Goyer, Michael Uslan and Chris Corbould call call it reliable. And nice. However, the other websites might be a little tricky. Alientraveller said it's good to only use sites like those for interviews and set visits, when information comes directly from the source. Then again, the doesn't explain http://www.scifiscripts.com or http://www.dailyscript.com. Comment - On general principle, none of those places are reliable. If "DailyScript.com" and "SciFiScript.com" are placed to get scripts, then absolutely no. You need to find a source that talks about the script, as the actual script is difficult to authenticate. Unless those other sources have personal interviews they are conducting, then they aren't reliable. Batman-on-film is a fansite. It's like Kryptonsite.com for Smallville. It may be accurate, but it isn't reliable. background:Maroon;color:Gold &amp;BIGNOLE&amp; (Contact me) 23:50, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
Comment: I think that except for SuperHeroHype.com, which is published by Coming Soon Media, L.P. and Crave Online Media, LLC, the other websites are self-published. Per WP:SPS, I don't think that the websites besides SuperHeroHype.com would be acceptable because they're not run by established experts who have been published elsewhere. How dependent is the article on these resources? Perhaps you could find a way to replace the resources: "However, caution should be exercised when using such sources: if the information in question is really worth reporting, someone else is likely to have done so." —Palatino LinotypeErik (talk • contrib) 23:51, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
Well I did fix the sci-fi scripts link because of a script review from IGN. I guess everyone agrees on Superhero Hype! since you guys use it in all of your other articles. background:Maroon;color:Gold &amp;BIGNOLE&amp; said that "unless those other sources have personal interviews they are conducting, then they aren't reliable". Yes, all of those websites have personal interviews they are conducting. So I guess that pretty much solves everything, right? Wildroot (talk) 01:04, 25 October 2008 (UTC) We don't use, or at least we shouldn't, SHH unless they has word-of-mouth information. If they're doing scooper reports, then no..and SHH likes to do a lot of "inside information" reports...just like BOF.com has their "insider" that gives them information. Without specific names of someone they contacted, then it really isn't reliable because rumors are rumors and that is what that information is when someone official has not announced it. background:Maroon;color:Gold &amp;BIGNOLE&amp; (Contact me) 02:26, 26 October 2008 (UTC)It was a Michael Uslan interview. Not "a-I-just-heart-from-one-of-my-inside-sources-at-Warner-Bros." type of report. Wildroot (talk) 02:34, 26 October 2008 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
<turn_text>The Tim Burton article is not backed up by any sources. This article is. Trust me, I read like six different books to see who was right. I'm responsible for the status of this article.&amp;</turn_text>
