<turn_topictext>The following has been added to "In Culture" "Turing appears as a character in the 1999 novel Cryptonomicon by American writer Neal Stephenson. The bestselling book is a fictional account of codebreaking during World War II along with related plot developments. The text includes references to Turing's homosexuality." It reads OK to me. It shows that Turing has become a significant character in modern times. It links to another Wikipedia article. Can't see a problem with it. HiLo48 (talk) 01:10, 7 January 2010 (UTC) Yeah Its Fine. It shows even though he was a homosexual he was a great mathematician. 10:54, 22 January 2010 (CMS) font-size: smaller;autosignedâ€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.153.118.208 (talk)</turn_topictext>
