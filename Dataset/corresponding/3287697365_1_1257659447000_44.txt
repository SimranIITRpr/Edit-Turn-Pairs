<edit_comment>/* Failed landing */  thermal imagery shows location, but  ISRO has not described its potential condition.</edit_comment>
<edit_text>Deleted Dr. K Sivan, made an announcement that the lander has been located on the surface of the moon with the help of thermal imagery from the orbiter and that the agency is trying to establish communications with it</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>Lots of news outlets reported, and this Wikipedia article now says, that the lander was located on the surface by thermal imaging. There's just one problem with that: the orbiter doesn't appear to have a thermal camera. The orbiter does have an "Imaging IR Spectrometer" (though whether it's suitable for thermal imaging as well as its purpose of mineral mapping is unclear), and it was suggested to use it to find Vikram, but that has not been reported as having happened, and no such image from it has ever been published, to my knowledge. In the discussion up above (¬ßClarification needed), there's even a quote from K Sivan saying it was "a normal photo", not thermal. So, can we remove the erroneous mentions of thermal imaging from the article? While the cited sources may be "reliable sources" in general, that doesn't mean they never make mistakes, especially when reporting things secondhand. ‚Äì PointyOintment ‚ù¨üí¨‚Ä¢‚å®‚ù≠  02:39, 26 September 2019 (UTC)

I agree, there has been no official comment on it and even K Sivan was vague about method of imaging so perhaps it should not be specified what kind of imagery it was till more details arrive. For what it is worth IIRS might have observed the surface exposed after impact, but we don't have many details on it.  Ohsin  05:59, 26 September 2019 (UTC)
The ISRO sources, whether official or not, are definitely contradictory. I too am OK at removing the word "thermal", and simply state that ISRO claims some sort of imaging was done. Rowan Forest (talk)
Regardless of the technique allegedly used to image its location, why ISRO didn't mention its location? Why it was not shared with NASA's LRO team that is trying to help? NASA's statement mentioned that the lander may not even be in the vast area imaged by the LRO -and it did image the complete plateau and surrounding terrain. Since they still don't know its location, it sounds like the CY-2 orbiter never actually imaged its location, never mind a high resolution image of the "intact lander tilted on its side". Question the answers. Rowan Forest (talk) 17:13, 30 September 2019 (UTC)
Appears very likely those comments were hasty but Sivan did say they have located it.[1][2]
"Yes, we have located the lander on the Lunar surface. It must have been a hard-landing," Sivan told PTI

Another interview where he is claiming the same. Ohsin  00:33, 20 October 2019 (UTC)
Either they found it or not; it cannot be "found" and "not found" simultaneously. A NASA team is collaborating with ISRO on the search, that is no secret. NASA is very transparent compared with ISRO, and they stated it has not been found. Given the vast misinformation from ISRO since the crash, I would leave the article as it is now: "The mission's orbiter was reported to have imaged the location of the lander.[138] Unconfirmed reports, citing an ISRO official, stated that the lander was intact,[139] but there has been no official announcement by ISRO on the lander's actual location or physical condition."
I don't think we have to expand on the "found" & "intact" as it was not official and not substantiated, unless you want to create a section remarking the misinformation and/or conflicting information since the crash. If ISRO ever publishes the location and the image of the intact lander allegedly acquired over a month ago, then we will certainly reflect that. Why they have not shared the location with the NASA team that is helping them locate it? My opinion is that because of the Moon race, ISRO wants to claim a successful soft landing, but without any supporting evidence. Your thoughts? Rowan Forest (talk) 01:26, 20 October 2019 (UTC)
"Found" part per chairman's words is official as he has more than once claimed it was located, but yes nothing backs it so far. The 'intactness' part is completely unofficial by anonymous sources and should be avoided as there is no accountability to them, ISRO has also denied those claims.  Ohsin  03:17, 20 October 2019 (UTC)
ISRO may have imaged the expected landing zone (as NASA did x3), but the fact is that they have not found the wreckage yet. At least they now officially acknowledged that it crashed at high speed. It is disturbing that such public statement had to be forced by a politician. Rowan Forest (talk) 18:53, 2 December 2019 (UTC)

Indeed it is worth noting that another politician asked them directly location of lander and they didn't answer! With Vikram impact site now found by LRO I hope ISRO responds with a clarification.  Ohsin  00:01, 3 December 2019 (UTC)
They must have published the impact crater just after I finished my search today. Thank you! Rowan Forest (talk) 01:42, 3 December 2019 (UTC)
An interesting observation here is that since the lander does not have a center engine, landing with a single engine meant it tumbled while falling, so their "official" explanation that it decelerated better than expected is not credible. Their engineering and achievements are amazing, so I don't understand the reason for the continuous BS. Failure is an option on the road to success. Rowan Forest (talk) 02:02, 3 December 2019 (UTC)
Lander does have a central engine, and slide from a press conference points it out. But yes very frustrating. I am waiting to see what other independent experts deduce from the debris field and its spread.  Ohsin  03:05, 3 December 2019 (UTC)
Right, it was the early design that did not have it. The final design did. Thanks. Rowan Forest (talk) 17:52, 3 December 2019 (UTC).</turn_topictext>
