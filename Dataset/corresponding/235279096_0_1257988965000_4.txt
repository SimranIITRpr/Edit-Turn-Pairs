<turn_topictext>Here it is written that Abhijit Banerjee is by born Marathi. But this is not true. He was born in Mumbai but he is a Bengali by birth. His father was a prominent Bengali teacher. Just because his birth place was Mumbai, It doesn't mean he is Marathi. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Sm89am (talk • contribs) 15:35, 15 October 2019 (UTC)
