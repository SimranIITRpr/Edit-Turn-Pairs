<edit_comment>following [[Talk:Caroline_Flack]] discussion removing euphemistic language for which there is no consensus, it clearly does not meet [[MOS:EUP]]. Hedging language following talk discussion to reflect that no coroners report has been received so we are merely following media reporting.</edit_comment>

<turn_topictext>Can we not use "took her own life". Took it where? It's nothing more than a MOS:EUP. CassiantoTalk 17:19, 17 February 2020 (UTC)
@Cassianto: well if "died by suicide" is deemed to be not a euphemism, then there's no reason why "took her life" should be either. Both are in very common usage in reliable sources, but the latter is significantly more common in British sources (in particular those detailing Flack's death), so per WP:TIES that's the terminology we should use, assuming there's consensus not to say "committed suicide".  — Amakuru (talk) 17:27, 17 February 2020 (UTC)
I notice that at the moment the lead again says "committed suicide"—phrasing I generally prefer to replace with "died by suicide" (for good reason). I notice the CNN source used for the lead sentence also says "died by suicide". I didn't realize there were legal connotations around it in the UK though. Personally my preference is 1. died by suicide; 2. took her own life; 3. committed suicide—I feel like "took her own life" is edging into WP:EUPHEMISM territory and potentially might be difficult for ESL speakers, but if there are indeed legal concerns then I see the reasoning.

Well "died by suicide" sounds like a euphemism to me, like you've just swapped it for "committed suicide" so as not to offend anyone. The CNN source is American so presumably it's a more common phrase there, but almost all UK sources are saying "took her own life". See [1][2][3]. Please let's stick that unless there are strong reasons not to.  — Amakuru (talk) 08:25, 16 February 2020 (UTC)
I'd rather not read the Guardian, thanks, it has a tendency to make my eyes bleed. "Took her own life" is a euphemism, nothing more. The same as "passed away", "reached out", "resting place". Yuk, yuk, yuk. CassiantoTalk 17:34, 17 February 2020 (UTC)
Well I'm sorry to hear about your unusual ocular condition and sense of nausea when you hear the usage in question, but reliable sources and books appear to disagree with you, employing the term in formal writing, and that evidence has more bearing on the discussion than your insistence that a commonly-used phrase is a euphemism.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:42, 17 February 2020 (UTC)
The left loves being politically correct; and all three sources you provide are left-leaning. So why don't you just stick to the OED, seeing as that's what this place is supposed to be guided by. CassiantoTalk 17:56, 17 February 2020 (UTC)
If we have to use the word suicide we need to avoid "committed suicide", because that's not acceptable British English usage. There are cultural differences here between the US and the UK, and this is an article about someone from the UK. BBC Editorial Guidelines 5.3.47 https://www.bbc.com/editorialguidelines/guidelines/harm-and-offence/guidelines "5.3.47 We should be sensitive about the use of language. Suicide was decriminalised in 1961 and the use of the term ‘commit’ is considered offensive by some people. ‘Take one’s life’ or ‘kill oneself’ are preferable alternatives."; Guardian Style Guide: https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-s "Say that someone killed him or herself rather than “committed suicide”; suicide has not been a crime in the UK for many years and this old-fashioned term can cause unnecessary further distress to families who have been bereaved in this way."; National Union of Journalists https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/mental-health-and-suicide-reporting-guidelines/ "Remember suicide is not a crime so it is inaccurate to use the word ‘committed’. Describing someone as having ‘committed suicide’ reduces the person to the type of death or implies criminal or sinful behaviour. An alternative term is “died by suicide”." There are plenty more examples of the UK context of avoiding the word "committed" when describing suicide. DanBCDanBC (talk) 12:31, 16 February 2020 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
