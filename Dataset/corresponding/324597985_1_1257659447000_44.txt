<edit_text>On 7 January 2020, Padukone joined a protest-gathering at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] against the [[2020 JNU Attack]] and passage of [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019|CAA 2019]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theprint.in/india/deepika-padukone-shows-up-at-jnu-protest-sparks-twitter-calls-for-boycott-of-chhapaak/346150/|title=Deepika Padukone shows up at JNU protest, sparks Twitter calls for boycott of ‘Chhapaak’|last=|first=|date=8 January 2020|website=The Print|via=The Print|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=8 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bollywood Reuters 8 Jan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bollywood A-lister backs protesting students, faces boycott calls |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-student-protests/bollywood-a-lister-backs-protesting-students-faces-boycott-calls-idUSKBN1Z71CU |accessdate=8 January 2020 |work=Reuters |date=8 January 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]’s student wing, the [[Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad]] is blamed for the attack.&lt;ref name="Scroll 9 Jan" /&gt; The visit angered BJP leaders who expressed it in social media.&lt;ref name="Scroll 9 Jan" /&gt; Soon enough, the hashtags ''BoycottChhapaak'' and ''BlockDeepika'' began trending in Indian Twitter with members of the incumbent [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] contributing in its proliferation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/after-boycottchhapaak-offers-to-sponsor-movie-tickets-flood-twitter-2160828|title=After #BoycottChhapaak, Offers To Sponsor Movie Tickets Flood Twitter|website=NDTV.com|access-date=2020-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/curious-case-of-deepika-padukone-gaining-twitter-followers-after-boycottchhapaak-blockdeepika-trend-2449957.html|title=Curious Case of Deepika Padukone Gaining Twitter Followers After #BoycottChhapaak Trends|website=News18|access-date=2020-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scroll.in/reel/949189/in-a-bid-to-boycottchhapaak-many-trolls-tweet-cancelled-movie-tickets-for-exactly-the-same-seats|title=In a bid to #BoycottChhapaak, many trolls tweet cancelled movie tickets – for exactly the same seats|last=Staff|first=Scroll|website=Scroll.in|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, ''ISupportDeepika'' was floated which gained greater traction and by the end of the day, her follower count had increased significantly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/isupportdeepika-dominates-boycottchhapaak-twitterati-deepika-padukone/|title=#ISupportDeepika Dominates #BoycottChhapaak As Twitterati Hail Deepika Padukone’s Big Step|last=Team Koimoi|first=|date=2020-01-08|website=[[Koimoi]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;</edit_text>

<turn_topictext>This isn't marketing. Not sure who added it there, I have split it. Please explain with source if you disagree. --DBigXrayᗙ 21:45, 8 January 2020 (UTC)

It wasn't me who reverted the edit, but I don't see a problem either. The section is 'marketing and release', and supposed "boycotts", along with screen count/premiere and other factors belong within release, preferably as a subsection. The marketing part of the section pertains to only the trailer/posters, not the JNU visit. DeluxeVegan (talk) 04:29, 9 January 2020 (UTC)
It's sufficient to have it under the release section, because it's directly affecting the film's release. A sub-section within a section for one paragraph is unwarranted, per MOS:OVERSECTION. Krimuk2.0 (talk) 08:44, 9 January 2020 (UTC)
All right, I am ok with the release section.--DBigXrayᗙ 11:57, 9 January 2020 (UTC)
Please prove abvp was involved in attack as it is clearly written on this page whereas Delhi police crime branch has already said involvement of leftists group, so either change it or face the trial for misleading people by providing false information Vibhu98 (talk) 17:27, 11 January 2020 (UTC)

Please provide source for your assertion. The article is already sourced. --DBigXrayᗙ 17:29, 11 January 2020 (UTC)</turn_topictext>
